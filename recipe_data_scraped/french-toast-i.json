If your bread is turning out soggy, lower the heat a bit so that the inside has more time to dry out before the outside gets overdone.

If the bread soaks too long in the batter, the inside becomes really heavy and soggy, and doesn't cook all the way through.  Also, let the pan get really hot and add a pat of butter, then put the bread in, and cover with a lid.  I served it with a bit of icing sugar on top, and some maple syrup.  My husband eats it with berry preserves.  Yummy!",

I only used regular bread, not even thick bread and there was still not enough.  I would suggest doubling it or possibly just using time and a half the original ingrediants from the beginning.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and used a little extra vanilla.  Delicious starter recipe and I LOVED the nutmeg in it!  thank you for the good recipe.",

The end result was that no one complained, and I actually received kudos from those in my household.",

            "reviewBody": "Thank you for this recipe. The french toast is perfect everytime. This recipe is a basic recipe that is foolproof. I usually double this recipe and use and entire loaf of white bread, cook the french toast on my gas griddle,  put it back into the bread bag, and separate each piece with a square of wax paper. It freezes beautifully and I reheat it for my kids during the week in the toaster oven. I also add  2 packages of Truvia into the egg mixture. Thanks again for my family's favorite breakfast recipe!!",

The only thing I would change is next time I will add a little powdered sugar to the egg mixture.  I like my french toast a little sweeter.\n\nI had a loaf of old bread to use up, so I tripled the egg mixture.  I froze the leftover french toast, and it is just as good the second time around.  I just popped a couple of pieces in the toaster oven.",

            "reviewBody": "Great recipe! I doubled the recipe but only used 1 cup milk and no nutmeg or vanilla. I noticed many people say the custard is better baked, but I used a shortcut by using a coated skillet and put a lid on the toast for about 1-2 min per side with the skillet on MD-LOW temp. This way the custard bakes up a little. Keep flipping and covering. When the toast springs back to the touch on both sides, it's done!  I sifted some confectioner's sugar on top and let them go to town with syrup. **As an extra treat:** I also took the leftover mix, beat in 1 extra egg, and made a scrambled custard by pouring it into the skillet heat on medium and continually scraping the bottom then putting on the lid for a minute or so until it is no longer runny. It's a sweet treat to douse in syrup and a great side for the toast!",

I have been making french toast like this for years, but mine never came out \"just right\".  This is the right blend of ingredients to give you \"company worthy\" french toast to serve to family or friends.  To put my own spin on it, instead of using milk I use Coffee Mate French vanilla (liquid) creamer.  This produces a wonderful, slightly sweeter version that is \"bed and breakfast\" quality french toast.  Yummy, and all three sons eat it up and lick the plate clean!  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!",
