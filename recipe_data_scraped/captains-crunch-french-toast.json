    "description": "Inspired by a recipe I saw on television, I experimented with different combinations and came up with this.  This is a delicious and unusual variation on plain old French Toast.  Try it, I guarantee you'll love it!  Thanks to the Blue Moon Cafe in Baltimore for the inspiration. Not for the diet conscious, but it tastes so good you won't care! Put bread in a warm oven to keep heated until the rest of the bread is done, if needed. Serve with a dollop of butter and warmed pure maple syrup, if desired.",

I only used 2 eggs, omitted the heavy cream, used 3/4 cup of soymilk instead of 1/2 cup 2% milk, used vegetable oil instead of butter, and Life cereal instead of Cap'n Crunch (far less than the 1/2 package suggested by the recipe). Also, maybe it's just my stove, but I partiallly burned the first slice at 3 minutes on medium-high heat. I cooked the rest of them for 1 minute on medium heat and they cooked perfectly. With these changes, it was great! My family loved it. I will probably make again next time we need to use up some challah.",

I also needed a lot more Cap'n Crunch cereal than the recipe called for, probably about triple (1 1/2 cups).  The end result was really good - my kids loved it!",
