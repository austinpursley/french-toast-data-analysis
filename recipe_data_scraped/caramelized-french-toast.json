I halved the recipe because of the mixed reviews but there was nothing wrong with this recipe at all.  I didn't find it any sweeter than french toast with syrup.  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the carmel sauce after it cooked and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the egg mixture. Other than that, I didn't change anything and I ended up eating all four pieces myself ( I even ate one cold and it was GREAT!!!) If your brown sugar turns hard, if you add boiling water it will eventually disolve into a delicious carmel sauce.  Be patient and keep stirring...it's worth it!",

I suggest you read the reviews first.\n\nI've never actually made caramel before, so I just followd the directions exactly...\n     After I was done making the bread I put the brown sugar in the pan, over a medium heat.  It took quite a while to start melting, and before it reached the consistency I was waiting for it began to smell like it was burning.  When it was nearly all melted, I added the water (which was room temperature).  The sugar instantly hardenend (makes sense).  Obviously, there was no way to dip anything in this rock hard sheet of sugar that was floating in water, so I waited and stirred.  Pretty quickly, it began boiling and the sugar was slowly melting back into the water.  By now it definitely smelled funny.  I thought, maybe that's the way it's supposed to smell (remember, I've never made caramel before).  I continued cooking it until the sugar was basically all melted/combined with the water.  Then I dipped a piece of french toast in it and tasted it; It tasted funny, too.  \n   In the end, we had french toast the old fashioned way last night, with syrup.  I think I should have read the reviews first, but regardless, seems like a lot of extra work for something that (aside from the burned taste) was not that great a substitute for good old-fashioned syrup.",

When it starts to melt ( in about a minute over medium heat, no higher) SLOWLY add the boiling water to the pan a little bit at a time.  You can even try to add small amt of extra butter to thicken it a little.  i ended up not using all of the water and just added what I needed to get it to the consistency I wanted.  When all of the sugar is melted, you can gently boil it for another minute.  The key is to keep the flame no higher than medium and stir constantly.",

It didn't really \"caramelize\" though which is good because I had a recipe last week that did and made the worst mess on my dishes and I literally had to scrape the caramel sugar off those. But back to this recipe, the sugar syrup needs to cook a little more though on a lower heat as mine was starting to get a toasted sugar smell and it wasn't all melted yet. I ended up using quite a bit more butter than called for. I really enjoyed this and preferred this over the traditional maple syrup on plain french toast. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I did cook the sauce down for a few minutes before putting the french toast back in to thicken it up a bit.  And the only difference I did was to add less eggs, because we don't like our french toast so eggy.  This will be a definite keeper for Sunday breakfast.",

But to start, frying french toast in butter is not such a good thing unless you want really dark brown toast. High heat will turn your butter dark brown. I suggest a butter spray to \"cook\" the toast. Add your butter at the end when you add the brown sugar and then add only about a quarter cup of warm water, slowly! Your caramel topping will taste less burnt and more sweet and smooth. You could also add an eighth teaspoon of vanilla. Great winter recipe. Fast, easy to make, just use common sense.",

Thanks to other reviewers suggestions I also added hot water to the brown sugar, and turned the heat down to low when I added the sugar. Make sure you stir constantly because the sugar will burn! Also, adding hot water to the pan as soon as you are done cooking really does make clean up a snap! Thanks for a recipe I will use again and again!",

I tried this recipe today because my hubby was at work and I can experiment if it is only me eating :) Anyway, I followed the directions for the toast, adding a Tbsp. of cinnamon to the egg mixture. It tasted so good that I almost didn't make the sauce. - I did end up making it, but i think I messed it up a little. My brown sugar turned hard and then looked really dark brown after adding water. I don't know if that is the way it should look, but it tasted pretty good. I had to strain out the hard lumps of sugar to get the sauce, so that was kind of a hassle. I would ask that there be more specific directions to making the caramel sauce, but other than that, it is great. I will definitely make again (and perfect my sauce making). Thanks!",

I took other reviewers' advice to use boiling water, but I still don't think the caramelization was right.  The sugar smelled (and tasted) kind of burnt before it even finished melting, and it still left hard pellets of sugar once I added the water.  I'm not sure how long you're supposed to cook it after adding the water...I went about 2 minutes and it still hadn't melted the pellets but I was getting worried about the burnt smell.  I cooked it over medium high heat (7) as the recipe recommended...maybe it needs a lower heat??  I thought it was ruined, but it still tasted ok so I guess it wasn't a total loss.  But it was a lot of work for something that was quite similar to (and not quite as good as) maple syrup.  Thanks anyway.",

I asked him to just try it and is he glad he did! He thought it was awesome! We will definitely make this again soon! I made the french toast on a griddle and made the \"syrup\" in a saucepan. I melted 2 tablespoons butter over low heat and stirred about 3/4 cup brown sugar into the melted butter. I boiled about 1/2 cup water in a ramekin in the microwave and added the boiling water until it reached the consistency that I wanted. I just whisked in the water a little at a time and it turned out perfect! I did keep the heat at medium low. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the eggs and I was going to add vanilla and milk but we didn't have milk so I added french vanilla coffee creamer. We used potato bread. I also added chopped pecans and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. This was an amazing breakfast! Thank you!",

I used a whole loaf of Sourdough bread and we only had a piece and a half left(we have decided however not to get our blood sugar tested today!). Made the caramel sauce, I just added a bit of vanilla to mine, it came out beautifully. (You can over work the sugar and it will seize and be grainy so maybe that is what happened to the other reviewers) I also added some sliced bananas, YUMMY sounds everywhere!

I used less butter when frying the bread &amp; most of the 4tbs in the caramelization process. I'm glad I read the reviews because boiling water made more sense &amp; helped breakdown the sugar. You do have to watch the sugar because it can burn easy so I added the boiling water earlier leaving the sugar/butter on direct heat for only a short time. Overall a great meal, very filling, I used potato bread this time but next time may try a cinnamon swirl. My fianc\u00e9 said it was the best he\u2019d ever had because it was so different &amp; didn\u2019t need syrup although I did sprinkle w/ powdered sugar!",

If you add the water shortly after adding the brown sugar it turns out great. I dipped them in when it was still pretty liquid-y and it harded up on the plate. It was especially amazing with cinnamon bread! Tasted like carmel rolls! Three stars only because of the flaw in the instructions, otherwise a 5 - I will keep and make again when we have company.",

Next time I make it I will take the other advice of boiling the water first. I should've read the reviews first.  I might want to add cinamon and vanilla next time. The Brown sugar takes the place of maple syrup and you can sprinkle with powdered sugar. Yum! Still a good recipe.",

            "reviewBody": "Yummy! Sweeter than my regular breakfast preferences, but if I'm in the mood for a sweet start, this is perfect! I'm glad I read the other reviews before I made this because I think that boiling water is crucial to making the caramel sauce.  In fact, I was having trouble getting the brown sugar to melt so I added the hot water before it was melted, and I had the perfect caramel sauce in less than 5 minutes. Other than boiling the water for the sugar-sauce, I made 2 minor changes: (1) I halved the recipe and (2) I added cinnamon to the egg mixture. I think it's also important to use butter as the recipe calls for: it adds a perfect dimension to the caramel sauce which neither shortening nor margerine would provide.\n\nThis is delicious and quite sweet; and it would be great with fruit (the tartness would pair nicely with the sweet sauce) and whipped cream.  This would also be a great desert served with fruit or ice cream!  Wow, imagine this sticky French Toast as a base for a scoop of ice cream, nuts, and hot fudge!",
