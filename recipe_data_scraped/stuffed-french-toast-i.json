I used Nature's Own wheat and fiber bread and just spread the cream cheese on one slice, sandwiching it between another.  It held together just fine.  When it was done, I served it with tons of butter and a little sugar-free syrup.  Probably sounds gross to those of you not doing low-carb, but I really found it delicious!  The french toast tasted like regular french toast, and the warm, melted cream cheese made it wonderful!  Also very easy to make.",

Maybe a more experienced cook can figure out how to salvage this recipe, but I will keep looking for a better one.",

            "reviewBody": "I'm giving this only three stars because it wasn't as good as it sounded, and considering how fattening it is it should have been better! First of all, prep was a pain. I had a hard time slicing the bread just right, and an even harder time fitting the cream cheese in the pockets. Second of all, I just wasn't impressed with the flavor. It was kind of bland. Now, I will admit that I didn't use liqueur because the thought of it at 8:00 in the morning made me sick so I used french vanilla creamer instead (like the submitter suggests). I have used creamer when making french toast before and it always makes it excellent. Not this time. I also ran out of egg mixture before coating all of the slices but had extra cream cheese. Also, needed twice as much butter. But, I will say that the orange marmalade was great, it was the only part of this dish I really liked. Also, here's a tip I learned: Use clarified butter to cook the french toast in, that way it won't burn. Melt your butter beforehand and as it cools, skim off the white cloudy part with a spoon and use only the clear yellow butter remaining. Thanks for sharing but I really doubt I will bother to make it again.",

I chose to use just regular sandwhich bread, I omited the irish cream liqueur since I was making them for my kids as well and opted for plain half and half and I used a blackberry preserves instead of the orange marmalade since I don't like orange marmalade. Oh, and I also opted to put the preserves on the inside of the french toast as well. I covered one piece of bread with cream cheese and the other piece of bread with preserves, put them together and went on from there. So the french toast was stuffed with the cream cheese and preserves instead of just cream cheese. It was delicious!",

I love French toast and this is a wonderful sweet twist! I had the cream cheese at room temp and then spread evenly on the bread slices.  I do agree: I used baileys Irish cream and could not detect that particular flavor addition BUT to the untrained eye (e.g. my husband) it doesn't detract from the overall taste of this dish!  Still delish.  Also, I served with good ol' maple syrup. Would make again this again as is and may try another recipe that includes a jam or jelly addition. Thank you!",

            "reviewBody": "I made this recipe twice: once with \"regular\" bread and the second with pepperridge farms cinnamon bread. Both great. I love French toast and this is a wonderful sweet twist! I had the cream cheese at room temp and then spread evenly on the bread slices.  I do agree: I used baileys Irish cream and could not detect that particular flavor addition BUT to the untrained eye (e.g. my husband) it doesn't detract from the overall taste of this dish!  Still delish.  Also, I served with good ol' maple syrup. Would make again this again as is and may try another recipe that includes a jam or jelly addition. Thank you!",
