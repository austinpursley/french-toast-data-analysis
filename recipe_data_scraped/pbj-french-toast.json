I cooked this on my non-stick griddle. This was good but quite sweet--the kids especially liked this, they each ate two sandwiches. The sugar in the egg wash was unnecessary, in my opinion. I would make this again but omit the sugar in the egg wash.",

I really couldn't taste the raspberry liqueur, and if I were to make this again, think I'd just use raspberry extract.  It was good, but I'm a PBJ gal, so I knew this one was a sure thing!  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   Tried a new flavor combo today.  Used strawberry jam, skipped the liqueur and substituted a small amount of coconut extract.  Garnished with a sprinkle of confectioners sugar and some fresh strawberries for a tasty breakfast.",

The peanut butter and jelly is all melted between the French Toast--so yummy! No syrup needed, but I did sprinkle on some powdered sugar.",
