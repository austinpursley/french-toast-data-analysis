In the morning (midweek)I toasted SLICED almonds while I made up the egg mixture (as I am a fan of almonds but not almond extract and to go with the hawaiian bread, I substituted coconut flavoring), dipped about half of the precut bread and put in a pan in the refrigerator while I went and did my hair and makeup, came back pressed the almonds into the sticks and layed them all at the same time on my new electric family-sized griddle, cooked them about 15 mins @ 300 degrees, dusted them with powdered sugar, handed each family member an individual cup of syrup (available at my local 99 cent store) and off we all went! Delicious, fun and easy. Leftovers heated for 20 seconds in the microwave were terrific the next day, too. Next time, I'm going to try it with toasted coconut! Thanks. This one is a keeper!",

I followed the recipe and the end result was an amazing melt in your mouth, close your eyes, look up to the heavens, sigh in relief, yummy french toast. I used day old challah bread and after cooking it i sprinkled confectioners sugar, cinnamon and honey. Oh happy day! (Also, i didnt have any almonds on hand so i omitted the toasted almonds and almond extract).",

I used Challah bread (Challah I from this site) and that enhanced the heavenly-ness of this dish.  It was so, so good.  I wasn't sure what the baking powder/flour was about, but I did it anyway, and it never really incorporated, but floated to the top in little clumps, so I just skimmed that off and threw it away.  I also didn't do anything ahead, or toast the almonds.  After putting the bread in the skillet to cook, I sprinkled almonds on the wet side.  I only did one side, and it was fine that way.  Just made sure I served almond-side up.  I also used sliced almonds, which worked very well.  Served with pure maple syrup.",

A few changes that I made to the recipe were to...omit the oil, sprinkle nutmeg in the egg mixture too, use Sara Lee (thick sliced) honey wheat bread and dip each bite into some warm maple syrup.  Also, because all I had were the whole almonds...I chopped them up in a food processor and then used a collander to shake off the almonds that just chopped down to powder.  I wondered if I had heated the almonds first and then chopped them, if they would have chopped better??? I might try that next time.",

Next time, I will definately make sure I have some for mine!  I also didn't leave it in the fridge long enough, because we couldn't wait!  I left it in for about 20 minutes.  The bread did stick to the waxed paper, but not that bad.  My only problem was that the batter only coated about 7 slices, not 12 as the recipe states.  But that's okay.  I'll double it with no problem.  I think it was missing something, though I'm not quite sure what.  I think I'll try using a little nutmeg next time like another rating suggested.  The kids used butter and maple syrup, my husband used butter and powdered sugar, and I used margarine and apricot preserves.  The best part of it all is that my hubby loves French toast, but neither myself nor my kids care for it.  Now we can all be happy.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

The step of toasting the almonds may be skipped over entirely as the nuts will brown while the french toast are face-down on the griddle.  I use MUCH MORE mixture than is called for in this recipe.  I suppose the amount required depends on the thickness of the slices + the size of the loaf.",

I ended up coming up with another idea last minute, buttered the top of the toast, added maple syrup (medium amber 100% pure, non-GMO organic) then a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream followed by caramel syrup and hot fudge and a nice scoop of Cool Whip on top. There wasn't any left and we were all stuffed at about the halfway point, just tasted too good to stop eating it! My wife loved it and our 9-year-old thought we had given him dessert for breakfast!",
