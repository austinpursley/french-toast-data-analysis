Followed the recommendations of other reviewers and only dipped the bread slices in the egg &amp; milk mixture rather than soaking for 10 minutes. Sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on the top layer.  The consistency was perfect - melt in your mouth creamy &amp; custard-like.  It was a huge hit with children and adults.  Had several requests for the recipe and was asked to make it again for the next family breakfast.  Definitely a keeper!",

I read someone's recommendation to use sliced apples in the bottom as well, so I sliced some granny smith apples very thin and placed in the bottom of the baking dish along with the butter and brown sugar.  This had a perfect texture - not to dry and not too soggy.  There was enough sweetness that it didn't need any syrup, but I used a wee bit anyway.  :-D  I will be making this again and again, and I can't wait to have company over for breakfast so I can try this out on them!\n\nJulie",

Convenient, as the syrup is built in. :)  Be warned that it is a bit sticky. :)  Will definitely make it again.",

I invited people over for breakfast, and had planned on making overnight french toast... Except I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning at 8:00 a.m. and had to find a subsitute. This was better than I had imagined, and so easy too! My big casserole dishes were all in use, so I used about 1/3 of the bread in a 9x9 pan, and put the rest into individual ramekins (one piece per ramekin). Delicious. I do think the french toast in the casserole dish was best though. I did a second batch by request, and the second time, I flipped the french toast into the brown sugar mixture and baked for another five or ten minutes. It was FANTASTIC. Will make this again, forever.",

I put the bread in the pan, covered it with the egg mixture, sprinkled it with cinnamon, and let it set in the refrigerator over night.  While I was preheating the oven, I mixed up the caramel mixture and then poured it over the top. Baked as recipe stated.  It turned out fabulous!

The 11 yr old did say that it was really good \"once you got past the brown sugar\".\nI used a half of a French Bread loaf and all the pieces fit fine in the regular cookie sheet type pan.

I used a stale french baguette and prepared it first, before the sugar and butter, so that it would absorb the egg mixture...so I guess it sat for about 10 mins  (I'm slow on Sunday mornin's).   It's a keeper!",

I didn't soak the eggs for 5 minutes like the recipe said. I just laid them in the egg mixture for a few seconds then turned them over for a few more seconds.  I think if you soaked them for 5-10 minutes, they would be too soggy and never get crispy and firm up. The sauce on the bottom tasted great, but make sure you dissolve your brown sugar thoroughly, or it's really grainy. I added a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture, because that's what I put in regular french toast. Next time, I\"ll try cutting the egg mixture in half so I don't have so much left over.",

I cut the slices into Texas toast thickness (about 1\" as suggested) and then soaked them by holding them down in the egg mixture until the air/bubbles quit escaping from the bread.  I poured the leftover egg slowly over the pieces in the pan and let it soak in.  I cooked them for 25 minutes on an aluminum pan and then flipped the pieces over to cook for another 3 minutes in the oven.  Next time I might make more brown sugar mixture, but it was delightful just as Hennie wrote it!  (If you like pecans, you could mix some in with the brown sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan.)",

I was a bit confused because the top side doesn't get that done look that you would if you used a frying pan and flipped it. but it's great.  I was thinking you could quick hit one side in the pan and place the other side on the bake dish, but that might dry it out. Stick with this for the first time and tweek as you see fit.

I put the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon on the bottom as directed. Then I placed the plain bread in the pan over the topping. Next, I poured the egg mixture evenly over the top of each slice.  I covered the pan and put it in the refrigerator overnight. I popped it in the oven the next morning and baked uncovered.   This method allows me to fool others into thinking I'm a \"morning person\".",

            "reviewBody": "I thought this was pretty good, I may have over cooked it slightly as it stuck to the pan.  My mom suggested I maybe should have sprayed with Pam along with the sugar and butter mixture.  The kids loved the smell in the kitchen as it was baking, and they loved the look of the powdered sugar.  I was surprised that no one asked for syrup or butter, that must mean they liked it as is.  Next time I might increase the butter/sugar mixture, just to make it a little gooier.  I made this using two pans.  I laid the sliced french bread out in the first pan, then poured the batter over it and let it soak in.  Meanwhile, I spread the butter sugar mixture on the bottom of the second pan.  I then put the buttered pan over the first pan and flipped the bread into the buttered pan.  While the dish was cooking, I washed the first pan in order to flip the finished toast back on to the first pan.  I don't know if that's the best way to do it, but it worked for me.  Will make again.  It was an easy fix for my \"What should I make for breakfast when I've got all the cousins and grandma and grandpa here overnight\".  I served it with the Baked Brunch Omelet on this website, which was also a hit.  Everyone seemed impressed and the smell was wonderful!!  Thanks for such a fun recipe.",
