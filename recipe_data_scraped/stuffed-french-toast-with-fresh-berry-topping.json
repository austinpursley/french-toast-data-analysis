On such short notice I had to use regular bread, but it was fine. Had one leftover and my husband loved it the next day! I used blueberries I had in the freezer and garnished the dish - looked great! Maybe next time I will add a couple of tablespoons of Grand Marnier Liquor to the egg mix - Then it may deserve 5 stars!",
