Smells great when it cooks. High awe factor. Don't overbake. Make sure this delicate dish doesn't burn. \r\n",

It's French Toast with a personality disorder . . .the bottom is like a custard and bread pudding French Toast as others have said, and the top is crusty and toast like, similar to pan fried French Toast. If you don't like a crusty top, I'd recommend covering it; if you don't like custard like French Toast, I'd recommend laying it flat as others have done instead of stacking.  It's actually pretty good; hubs and I ate our portions today with syrup and fruit on the side.  This makes a lot of French Toast; we have enough for leftovers to toss in the freezer, but I flipped the remainder and put back in the oven so it will freeze okay--I'm thinking the custard part won't be so good in the freezer.  I halved the recipe and still got 4 servings.  I didn't use Portuguese bread for this; used a Christmas bread my godparents send us every year that has been hanging out in the freezer just waiting for recipes like this.  Thanks for the recipe!",

As other reviews said, bake it in a single layer on a cookie sheet. The 2nd batch i made with the older dryer bread I put in a casserole dish and let soak over night, then baked in a single layer. everyone loved it both times.",

            "reviewBody": "The folks who are down rating this recipe are, I think, expecting it to make classic French toast.  What it actually makes a kind of bread custard.  And as such it is EXCELLENT.  I fix it for special occasions like Thanksgiving or Christmas breakfast, and we love it.  Be sure to submerge all the bread in the milk mixture and put it in the fridge overnight before baking.",

            "reviewBody": "Best French Toast ever! I purchased a loaf of Portuguese Bread at the local Farmer\u2019s Market.  I decided it would be great for French Toast and was pleased when this was the first recipe after searching for French Toast. I used lemon peel rather than orange, though either would be good. My husband and grandson declared it the best they had ever eaten. I will keep this recipe to use even if I don\u2019t have Portuguese Bread.",
