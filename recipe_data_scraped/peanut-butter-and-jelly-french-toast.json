I used natural peanut buter and wholewheat read (like I always do) and Smucker's blackberry preserves-- I think preserves work really ell here, because they're s thick and rich.  I scaled the recipe to make one servng, but I ended uphaving to use twicethe eggsand milk thattherecipe called for-- otherwis there wasn't enough to saturate the bread,so you may want to increase the amount there.  Also,a little cooking spray eliminates the need for butter-- trust me you won't miss it, the peanut butter makes this plenty rich as it is!\r\nI loved it and plan to play around wit it-- maybe peanut butter an marshmallows-- or chocolate!!!\r\n",
