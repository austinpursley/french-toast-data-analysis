I also added two teaspoons of vanilla and a good amount ground cinnamon--that's what I add to all of my french toast recipes. This is seriously like french toast on crack. I used my cast iron skillet to deep fry these and it worked out fabulously. I served these with hot maple syrup. The family thought this was THE BEST french toast they've ever had.",

I've made this exact recipe twice, and it was okay... (Hence the 3-stars.) However, the past few times I've made deep fried French Toast, I've modified this recipe into what I think is a 5-star-worthy dish! Here's what I do, now:\n\n1 cup of flour.\n1-1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.\n1/4 cup of white sugar.\n1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. \n1 teaspoon of cinnamon.\n1 teaspoon of nutmeg.\n2 eggs.\n1 cup of milk.\n2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.\n\n-Preheat deep-fryer to 375. *(I've only ever used corn oil for these, but I imagine canola/veggie/peanut oils would work just fine. Also, I would highly recommend a deep-fryer, instead of a skillet, so as to make sure the slices are evenly fried, and to maintain a perfect 375 degrees. But again, I imagine that this recipe would turn out fine, if all you have is a pan/skillet.)\n\n-Mix all  dry ingredients, whisk in the wet, then pour into a casserole dish.\n\n-Dip your bread slices on both sides. *(Make sure to use a spatula, instead of tongs, so as not to rip the bread. *I've made this recipe with both white bread, and Challah slices. They both = superb, but Challah is my fave.\n\n-Place into the oil, 2-3 slices at a time. They float immediately, so cook on both sides until nice and brown.\n\n-Finish with sifted powdered sugar, and a few more dashes of cinnammon.\n\n-Don't forget the bacon!\n\nHappy eating!",

It was absolutely amazing because of the flour mixture and deep frying put it over the top. The southerner in me felt completely satisfied. Also I used the butter pecan syrup from ihop instead of regular maple syrup...talk about mouth explosion WOW! I will use this recipe everytime!",

I tweaked the recipe a little by adding cinnamon, vanilla extract and sugar for a much added sweetness. Since I didn't have any French bread available, I used regular whole wheat bread, and it is SO good!! I would eat the deep fried French toast for dessert, instead of having it for breakfast.",

I halved the recipe and used Arnold country white bread and added 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract to the batter. I also lightly sprinkled the finished slices with sugar and cinnamon. The unused slices I wrapped in plastic wrap and froze.  When I was in the mood for more I just popped a slice in the toaster oven and heated. Delicious!",
