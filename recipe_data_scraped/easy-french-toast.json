All you are doing is dipping very stale bread (although fresh is fine) in an egg milk mixture which should be more egg than milk. Some folks like their French Toast heavy on the cinnamon side, and others like it a little dry. I prefer my to have the texture of a custard which works even more if you use hallf and half, or light cream. I also recommend using butter in your skillet as opposed to oil.",

I've never made it before, and one of these days I really just need to copy all of my mom's recipes. I just wanted a simple, straightforward french toast. This looked like the one.\n\nWhat's wrong with this recipe? The batter is way too thin. Soak even the stalest bread in this mix for 20 seconds on each side, and you will have a pulpy mess. I even used brown eggs and whole milk, so I imagine I had the thickest version of the batter. If you dare try this, make sure you have the heartiest bread you can get your hands on. Even a nice, thick 7-grain will fall apart if soaked more than a few seconds.\n\nCan I give it half a star? I want to give it half a star.",
