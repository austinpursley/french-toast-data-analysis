    "description": "My husband and I were vacationing recently and had this lovely French toast at a bed and breakfast.  When we came back home, I kept missing it so I called them up and requested it.  They actually gave me the recipe over the phone!  I generally halve the recipe for my husband and I, and bake it in an 8 inch square pan.  Reheats well in the toaster oven.  I served it to my in-laws recently and they loved it. Serve with a little sweetened whipped cream and berries!",

            "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't need to modify it at all, but I did based on what I had available.  I substituted walnuts for pecans and added orange-flavored cranberries before layering the bread.  The flavor was excellent and the walnuts helped to tone the richness of the french toast.  The only note I would add is that I would let it set for approximately 10-15 minutes before serving.  The butter, sugar, syrup mixture needs a little time to carmalize and the french toast retains the heat for quite a while after serving.  The 10-15 minutes will also allow the bread to firm up a little and arrive at a nice texture.",

I also used brioche instead of French bread and was delighted with the results!\r\n\r\nThank you (and the bed &amp; breakfast you and your husband stayed at!) for supplying this amazing recipe.

After having read over 200 reviews of the recipe, I made the following adjustments:   greased bottom and sides of the 9X13 pan with shortening (for easier release of the baked french toast); cut the slices of french bread 1\" thick; added twice the amount of orange zest; used a total of 6 whole eggs (both yolk and egg white) and 1/2 c. + 2 T. 2% milk for the liquid mixture (to better cover all of the bread); baked the dish for 45 minutes; and let the dish set for 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven before serving it.  I did not add the white sugar to the liquid mixture, but I did use an entire cup of light brown sugar for the pecan topping as the recipe called for.  My company loved it and immediately asked for the recipe.  It made 6 large or 8 small servings.",

The orange flavor is just perfect and the brown sugar caramel that comes out of the pan is wonderful.  I was scraping it all onto my plate this morning.  Doesn't need syrup, jam, or sugar - it's great as is! I also loved that it used 3 egg whites because the cheesecake I made took 3 egg yolks, so no waste.",

Not only did they look incredible, they tasted just as good as they looked! We decided that whipped ream would be the best on them but my son prefered them with nothing. This is such a great recipe....thank you for sharing!\r\n\r\nUpdate; Made these once again for Chrismas Brunch and once again, amazing. Prepare the nite before. Didnt change a thing, but again, served with fresh whipped cream to tone down the sweetness. Excellent! No syrup needed.:)",

I used 8-9  1/4 inch thick slices slightly overlapping in 2 layers, in small oval baking dish.  I was in a rush so it only refrigerated for 15 minutes, but all the liquid was absorbed into the bread before it went into the oven. It came out very puffy, but deflated as it cooled a bit. It was delicious and moist even though the top looked a little dry. Not bsure why the recipe puts the sugar and pecan    mixture on the bottom and not the top since the casserole is not inverted when you serve it. A much easier and less fattening recipe than Paula Deen's French Toast Casserole, which I have made and is scrumptious. \nThis is a definite keeper.",

I will make this again but cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup for the topping and leave off dusting with confectioner sugar. Also will lay down foil then grease. \nthe sugar and nuts  stick to the pan when cooled off. I also love the orange flavor that it gives.",

I followed one reviewer's recommendation to use frozen loaves of french bread- Pepperidge Farm or your local grocery store brand- so that the pieces didn't get too soggy.  Worked out PERFECTLY.

Dry texture white bread like the days old italian i used worked perfectly! \n\n*****the first time i made this and followed the directions exactly, it was pretty sweet.  Hands down, this is still the best sweet thing i ever made and ate! ****The second time I made this, I used half the sugar for the topping and did not put any sugar into the egg mixture.I think much better. I made this in two layers in an 9 x 13 baking dish and poured the milk/OJ/egg mix over top BOTH slices of bread. NOTE: the amount of serving says 12 but double layered, i got 4 servings out of this. To get 12 servings it must be a 1 x 1 inch square serving. Not enough food! There is no way i can make this a low fat, low sugar thing and still taste this good so I'm not going to try. I will eat this full fat and enjoy every minute of it.",

When you serve it, flip the slice over on the plate so you can see the nice pecan caramel topping.  This is very, very sweet and a wonderful treat for a holiday.",

(I halved the sugar and it was still very sweet. I'd recommend quartering the sugar, especially if you want to use syrup or whipped cream.)  Partly because of all that sweetness,  do expect that this will taste more like a cinnamon or orange roll rather than traditional french toast.",

We each ate two slices; according to the recipe, that's two servings, but two didn't really seem excessive.  This is a keeper!  Thanks, SR.",

            "reviewBody": "We had this for breakfast this morning and it was very good.  After reading other reviews about how sweet it was I didn't add the corn syrup, the white sugar or powdered sugar on top.  I think I had the brown sugar mixture a bit uneven because some places it seemed to be a bit much and other places was just right.  I toasted the pecans for the richer flavor.  I had both challah and french bread I needed to use up, not enough of one for the pan so I used both, cut into 1 inch slices.  In the places where the bread didn't fit together tight I put in some pieces of bread to take up the space.  I had 4 eggg whites in the fridge so I used all 4 and the 2 whole eggs.  I forgot to add the orange zest but the orange flavor was still noticable, I will add it next time for some extra flavor.  I baked it for 40 minutes because I wanted it a bit more brown that what it was at 35.  We let it sit for about 10 minutes before cutting it and had no soggy bread problems, nice and moist and tasty.  Next time I make this I was thinking about mixing some cinnamon with the brown sugar, melting the butter in the bottom of the pan and sprinkling the brown sugar over it.",
