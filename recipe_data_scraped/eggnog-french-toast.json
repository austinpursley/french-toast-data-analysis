BUT if you want eggnog french toast, simply follow your traditional recipe for making french toast but use eggnog instead of milk or cream.  Use nutmeg instead of cinnamon. I make it every Christmas morning and the entire family raves over it. Key to it not being soggy is to not over soak the bread.  I cut it in triangles, lay it out like a Christmas tree and use a link sausage as the tree trunk. Sprinkle the plate with conf sugar to look like snow. The kids like the \"tree\" sprinkled with green sprinkles.  Makes a lovely table.",

Only thing I did differently, was to cook each slice in a skillet with a little butter instead of baking the slices. Then I sprinkled with a little powdered sugar.  Some had a nice buttery syrup on top, too. Will certainly make this again. (Family thought they were at a Bed and Breakfast with this one!) :)",
