I whisked in about 3 tbsp of flour and 2 tbsp of sugar into the egg/milk mixture.  I did not have cream so I used milk and still got good results.  I also put in a small pinch of salt.  I read that putting flour into the milk mixture will help the bread to get crispier and it did!!   Also, use lots of butter in your pan which helps the bread to get a crispier coating.  The result is a french toast with a nice crispy brown outside and the inside had a nice combination of a bread / custard-like texture.  I do not like french toast that has a heavy custard texture on the inside!!  The flavor has a nice balance of sweet and somewhat savory with the ginger/salt combination.  Oh and I also added a dash of nutmeg as I do to most things that I bake.",

Also, because I did not have heavy cream, I used fat free evaporated milk because it's good at mimicking the thickness and richness of cream. I doubled this recipe (we're big on french toast in this house--my husband and kids can eat almost a whole loaf in one sitting) and I was a little more liberal with the spices. I served this with my homemade maple-vanilla syrup and we all just loved this french toast. This might be my new go-to recipe to make french toast from now on. NOTE: I did not use the butter to cook the french toast. I used my huge countertop grill which is VERY non-stick, so the butter was unnecessary. We spread it on the hot french toast after. ;)",

I used plain old white bread. \n\nI am lacto-intolerant and he drank all of his 2% milk other day so I subbed Silk Soy Milk. \n\nNext time I think I would use 2 tbls and 2 tsp of molasses.

I whisked in about 3 tbsp of flour and 2 tbsp of sugar into the egg/milk mixture.  I did not have cream so I used milk and still got good results.  I also put in a small pinch of salt.  I read that putting flour into the milk mixture will help the bread to get crispier and it did!!   Also, use lots of butter in your pan which helps the bread to get a crispier coating.  The result is a french toast with a nice crispy brown outside and the inside had a nice combination of a bread / custard-like texture.  I do not like french toast that has a heavy custard texture on the inside!!  The flavor has a nice balance of sweet and somewhat savory with the ginger/salt combination.  Oh and I also added a dash of nutmeg as I do to most things that I bake.",
