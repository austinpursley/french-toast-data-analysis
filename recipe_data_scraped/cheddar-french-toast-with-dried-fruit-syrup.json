The only thing I would say is that the bread MUST be an inch or more thick, and as another reviewer recommended, be a day old or so. Soft fresh bread, which we used, didn't hold up for the pockets. My other recommendation would be to strain the dried fruit from the syrup after sitting overnight, then apply the syrup and fruit to your liking. Good eats!",
