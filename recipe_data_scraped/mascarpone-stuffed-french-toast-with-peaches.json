            "reviewBody": "This recipe was delectable. I have prepared French toast per this recipe three times and the French toast has been awesome each time.  Each time I have used Texas Toast as I could not source the Mexican Bolillio Rolls. I find that if you don\u2019t over saturate your bread in batter (to a point of sogginess) and that if your skillet or griddle is hot enough, the mascarpone filling should not melt as it takes the toast less than a minute (about 45 seconds)  to brown on each side. This is a recipe that one should definitely try more than once--making adjustments according to one\u2019s taste; i.e. with different fruit, etc. Also to those who cannot locate Mascarpone cheese or the cheese is too expensive etc., I have found an awesome substitute for Mascarpone cheese that is as good as, if not better, than the real thing.  Enjoy!  Mascarpone Cheese Substitute: 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese  1/4 cup heavy whipping cream  2 1/2 tablespoons sour cream  Combine well. Do not substitute low fat cream cheese or sour cream.",

The only changes I made were: I used french bread instead of bollio, and I added regular sugar to the mascarpone in addition to the powdered, because I didn't think the confectioners cut it.   Also, since it wasn't peach season, U used frozen peaches and it still came out really well. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone!\n****UPDATE: I just wanted to share a much easier way of  making this. Forget the loaf and cutting and stuffing! Just buy a presliced loaf of french sandwich bread and spread the filling between two slices and make as normal. So much easier and I say even better!",

My husband stated that he much preferred this breakfast to anything else we've had before because it's not overtly syrupy sweet like so many other french toast/pancake recipes. The only changes I made was using canned peaches as this was a last minute recipe and I didn't have fresh.  Since the canned peaches were already sweeter than fresh I did not add the granulated sugar, but just left in a little bit of the light syrup it came in and then seasoned according to the recipe. I also used plain bread slices as I've never even seen Mexican Bolillo Rolls in my small northern town. I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future.  Thanks so much!",

While they all said they enjoyed it and that it was good... I was a little less impressed.  Used the bread suggested and I don't know, just seemed to much bread to filling ratio.  I will make again but making a few changes.  Probably will try Texas toast and making a sandwich version before frying in a pan.  Peach topping was very good and could see other toppings being just as good.",

We took the suggestions of others to grill the french toast first and then stuff it with the marscapone.  Came out really great!  We made our own challah bread in bread maker, sliced it about 1 inch thick.  It looked great and tasted great.  We passed on the peach topping, but may try it next time when peaches are in season.  We will absolutely make this again!",

My peaches were not all that ripe and way pre-season (I did this Valentine's day in Ohio), so I added about a 1/4 cup of orange juice to the pan to help them cook - they turned out spectacular, not too sweet and a great fresh peach taste (I can't imagine doing this with canned peaches).  I also added a little extra powdered sugar to the Mascarpone - I would recommend doing a little sampling and sweetening to taste =) I used a fat baguette of fresh sourdough bread because that is what I had; and I bet pretty much any kind of bread would work \u2013 as long as it is in \u201cslice yourself\u201d form.  I also skipped the plastic bag and just used a fork to stuff my slices, and it worked just fine.  I cooked them on an electric griddle with the recommended butter/oil mix.  The pictures uploaded here don\u2019t do the recipe justice\u2026 mine came out looking absolutely elegant and I will definitely do it again for guests.",

            "reviewBody": "Made this for breakfast this morning, and it satisfied everyone's sweet tooth cravings. I had been meaning to make this while peaches were in season, but by the time breakfast came around I either had no mascarpone, or I ate all of the peaches. Instead, today I used canned pears instead of peaches, and orange zest instead of lemon, as I'm not generally a fan of incorporating sourness into anything for some strange reason. With my 29oz canned pears, I had to add about half of the syrup to ensure there was liquid in the pan while making the sauce. If you go this route, you'd be pretty safe either cutting back the sugar or eliminating it altogether. Now for the filling, I didn't use any real measurement of how much orange zest to add, I simply added a bit, stirred it well enough to mix it in, and do a small taste test. I was only making enough toast for 2 adults and a child, so the filling and batter I cut by half. This made enough for 9 slices (cut 1.25\"). The sauce I didn't cut in half, and knowing what I know now I will in the future. I always like to have a bit more on hand rather then not enough. I wish we had bolillo rolls locally, but no luck. As others suggested, I wouldn't fill the toast until after they cook, as the cheese will turn to liquid and you'll end up with soggy french toast. I added mine immediately after removing from the skillet and served thereafter. Great breakfast!",

I used frozen sliced peaches (~2 cups) to save time and cooked them with 1/4 c of maple syrup instead of the sugar.",

Taste the peaches first.  Then, cutting down and trimming those rolls.... forget it.  i wont do that again!  the mascarpone mixture was, unfortunately, nothing rememberable.  very sad that this was overshadowed by the amazing pecan bacon that i made as an accompaniment.  glad so many of you enjoy this, but we will keep looking for \"our\" french toast recipe.  :-)",

I also followed another reviewers suggestion and poured the egg mixture over the bread and let it sit while I made the peach sauce before I cooked the toast. I couldn't quite figure out how to get the mascarpone mixture to not spill out the sides of the bread but it really didn't matter. It was delicious and the only suggestion my boyfriend made was to sprinkle a little confectioner's sugar on top the next time.",

Problem is the mascarpone is not the proper texture to be a \"filling\".   I read many reviews before trying this myself and decided to not \"fill\" a bread pouch since it seems the middle just liquifies anyway during the cooking.   So I cooked my slices alone and made small sandwiches afterwards with the mascarpone filling between two slices.   Just the warmth of the french toast melted the filling down to a oily glaze right away.  By the time it made it to anyone's plate, half the filling was on the serving pan floor .     Tasted good, but I wasn't wowed enough by it to save this recipe.     Regular cream cheese (with a higher melting point) might work better and have a stronger taste.",

Used frozen mixed fruit (surprised at the beauty of the fruit) that I cooked down beyond syrupy.  The thicker it got, the better it tasted.  This would be a beautiful topping for ice cream or cakes.  Used French bread and made sandwiches.  Learned that the toast needed to be cooked on high heat or it takes forever.  After making a dozen sandwiches (2 per person) I had used up a loaf of bread, all the mascarpone mixture, all the egg breading, a stick of butter and all the fruit.  Will make it again but may do as much of it as possible the day before or feed fewer people.",
