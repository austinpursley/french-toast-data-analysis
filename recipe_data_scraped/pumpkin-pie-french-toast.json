I could taste the pumpkin in this recipe and the flavor overall was great. I used whole grain bread as I wanted to make this as a healthy breakfast for my family however, if I was making this simply to indulge tastebuds, I would go for slices of french bread and top it all off with generous dollops of spiced whipped cream, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a good drizzle of maple syrup, as suggested. The whole family loved this recipe.",

I tried a bit and thought it was pretty good, though I might like to increase the pumpkin to a half cup and maybe cut the half-n-half to a quarter cup next time to REALLY taste the pumpkin. Using the maple-vanilla syrup with it was a good idea.",

Even though I stirred the batter though between bread dippings, the walnuts tended to slide to the bottom of the batter, so that the first pieces of toast had few nuts and the last ones had the bulk of them. To compensate next time, I will use a serrated spoon and scoop up some walnut pieces from the batter to sprinkle on the tops of breads as they are lowered onto the griddle. I tried this out toward the end and it worked well.",

My daughter said that this was the best french toast ever, but that it didn't really taste like pumpkin.  She loves cinnamon, so I think that is what she enjoyed so much.  This makes a great dipping batter and the bread cooked up beautifully. Plus, it smelled soooooo good cooking this morning.  Served with fresh whipped cream and syrup - this is a great breakfast for the fall months.",

This is a great fall/winter breakfast, and I'm sure little ones would love it too. Thank you for sharing-this is so creative!",

Used separate spices instead of pumpkin spice (cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg). There are a couple of easy recipes on this site. \n3. The best part of all - he used cinnamon swirl bread!!!  My favorite for ANY french toast :)\n\nEnjoy - really nice holiday recipe!",

Personal preference really, but there is also a balance to consider.  Turthfully if pumpkin  is your goal, you'll want a bit more pumpkin spice.  Also start with a well warmed pan but not scorching hot.  Scorched egg is an awful flavour.  Good luck Turtles??",
