The second time I made it, I was more careful with the syrup mixture to make sure it didn't boil and that way it didn't get so hard and chewy.  I sprayed my glass dish with pam and it did not stick.  I also added a dash or two of cinnamon to the egg mixture and it was excellent.  Definitely a quick and easy dish to make and very easy to increase or decrease the size!!",

Well this recipe fit the bill.\r\n\r\nI made the french toast exactly as the recipe called for but i used regular store bought sliced cracked wheat bread instead of the unsliced white bread.  I also buttered the baking dish before putting any ingredients in it.\r\n\r\nEveryone loved it, and my sister-in-law took the recipe home with her to try it herself.\r\n\r\nI was hoping to see how any leftovers would reheat in the microwave but needless to say there wasn't a scrap left to reheat.\r\n\r\nI will definitely make this again and thank you for making our Sunday morning so enjoyable.\r\n\r\n",

I sprayed the bottome of a glass 9\"x13\" pan w/cooking spray. I let the syrup mixture come to a boil before I poured it into the pan. I layered sliced french bread, crust on, over the syrup and then poured the milk egg mixture over that. I let it sit covered overnight in the fridge. The next morning, I placed the glass pan containing the french toast into a metal pan filled with 1/2\" of water. I baked it in the oven, covered, for 30 min. I then uncovered the dish and baked it for an additional 20 min. It came out fantastic! The caramel syrup didn't stick to the pan at all and the bread was lightly toasted on top. This is one of my favorite new recipies and I know I'll make it again and again.",

I toasted and double layered some left-over white bread because I needed to use it up, and I wonder if that's why it was a little squishy in the middle. It did get pretty hard on the top from baking which was good, but the center just wasn't done enough... Probably not the recipes fault.",

While the taste is unique and not unpleasant, it would best be described as a caramel breakfast custard as apposed to a \"french toast\".  These are the things that I think make the best casserole.  Use substantial bread, like a pan french loaf (crust on or off doesn't seem to make much difference).  I have added chopped pecans over the caramel and prefer it this way.  As per the recipe - I don't simmer the caramel - but just melt the sugar and butter together until well melted, then your caramel won't candy and crystalize on you.  I have also thought that maybe next time I would make in individual ramekins and serve individually.  This recipe definately has potentential.",

I was also out of corn syrup so I had to subsitute by making a simple syrup of 2T of sugar and 3T of water and simmering it.... when I layered the bread (soft oatmeal bread) I sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on each layer I also added abt a teaspoon of each 2 the custard mixture..baked @ 350 for 50 mins.",

I added 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon  of nutmeg to the egg mixture. I added 2 Tablespoons of dark rum to the caramel mixture after removing it from the stove. After I spread the mixture into the pan, which I sprayed with coconut oil, I sliced 3 ripe bananas over the top. I baked the dish for 30 minutes covered, in a bath of water(about 2 inches) and then removed the foil and put 6 pats of butter(quartered) over the top of the dish and put bake in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.  The dish came out delicious!!! The only thing I would do different the next time, is use challah bread and leave the crust on.  Omitting the crust from any type of bread, in my opinion is a big mistake.",

The only changes I made,increase the amounts of everything by 1/2, broke the bread into chunks instead of slices and put it in a lasagne pan. Oh so delicious. I lined a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and turned the, Pam sprayed, pan onto the cookie sheet. I was quite surprised that it was NOT too sweet.",

I substituted corn syrup with honey, and used half butter half coconut oil and cooked around 55 minutes. Then lightly dusted the toast with a mix of cinnamon and confectioners sugar.  It is super sweet and would add a dash more salt and an extra egg to balance it out next time.",

I used pre-sliced texas toast (with crusts cut off), and baked 5 min longer than the recipe states. I also used half light and dark brown sugar. The topping tasted great. It had a nice caramel flavor to it that was amazing. The top toasted a little bit, but the problem I encountered was the texture of the bread. It was very custard like, very soggy, and tasted eggy, and while it didn't taste bad, the effect was off putting. I'm going to try reducing the milk and egg next time, and maybe leave the crust on to see if that helps. Otherwise, not a bad recipe.",
