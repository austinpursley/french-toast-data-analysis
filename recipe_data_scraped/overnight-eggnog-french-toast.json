Instead of eggnog, you can use whole milk and add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a tablespoon of vanilla.",

I cut the bread into large cubes.  I did also add extra cinnamon (1/4 tsp) and nutmeg (1/8 tsp) as I usually add more to the eggnog I buy at the store.  I liked being able to prep the night before and bake in the morning.  I was worried about the cooking time and did leave it in about 15 minutes longer.  Next time I will take it out closer to the recommended time though as it does continue to cook after removing from oven.",

I set the oven to 350\u00b0 and put it in for another 35 mins. I put it back in to brown @375\u00b0 and after 7 mins it still wasn't browned. It was still a loose when we decided to eat it. Tasted okay but the crust on the bread was really tough. If I ever make this again I'll use Texas toast but I doubt I'll ever make it again.",

I will make this every Christmas! Husband who hates mushy french toast LOVED it and everyone wanted recipe! No syrup needed but a squirt of Reddi Whip and a sprinkle of fresh blueberries or strawberries makes this HEAVENLY! I prepared as written with a few minor adjustments: a did prepare night before &amp; sprinkled a little cinnamon on top, I also turned to broil for last 2 minutes of cooking to get a good brown on it and I lightly sprinkled with powered sugar after I took it out to make it look pretty!

I couldn't find eggnog so I used the heavy cream and spices, but went a little heavier on the spices.  I also substituted 1 T of maple syrup and 1 T of honey in place of the 2 T of corn syrup.  I think that worked just fine.  Baked it a bit longer than was recommended.",

A trick I learned from another recipe is to put a second 9 x 13 pan on top of the saran wrapped dish before you put it in the fridge. The weight of the second pan makes sure everything is saturated in the morning. I baked it the first 35 minutes and then upped the temperature to 375 and baked it an additional 25. It was perfect. I let it set up for a bit and sliced into squares and served. Perfection!",

I use good quality dense white bread rather than French bread as I find it has a nice consistency throughout rather than the thicker crust and airier inside of French bread.

Why not state in terms of ounces? Some loaves will result in slop, others too dry. It is easy enough to estimate visually how much of a 20 oz loaf is 15 oz., for example, and will reduce the likelihood of a poor result from the recipe. The variability in the rater feedback is clearly a function of this.",

I should have cubed the bread instead of slices as people were confused and just peeled peices of bread out instead of digging down to get the brown sugar layer (tasty!). I cooked mine at 350 instead of 325, and then 375 at the end. I then ended up leaving it in the oven (had turned it off) to keep warm for about 10 minutes and the top peices of exposed bread went all nice and crusty and delicious. I too added nutmeg and cinnimon... some people added maple syrup, although it wasnt needed at all. def a keeper.",

I made a few very simple changes but basically followed the recipes as written.  I used brioche bread and cut it into about 1-inch squares, soaked overnight in the custard.  In the morning when it was finished cooking I flipped the pan so that ooey-gooey topping was on top.  (That topping is hot, so be very careful flipping it)  WOW, knock out dish, I'm going to making quite a lot.  So easy, but oh so good.",

I only used about 3/4 of the liquid mixture in a 7x11 deep pan (gluten free bread is smaller than regular bread). Next time I will use 3-4 loaves, pour in all the liquid mixture and use a 9x13 pan. I did brown it up a bit under the broiler for a couple minutes before serving. I also used lots of cinnamon and topped it with sprinkled icing sugar. If you let it sit for a bit before serving, it will thicken and continue to absorb liquid. Thanks so much....this is a keeper recipe!",

Most people were right to extend the baking time. I left mine (foil covered) in the oven for close to an hour then took the foil off and baked for the additional 7-10 minutes. It turned out to be the perfect blend of creamy custard and bread pudding, with that gorgeous buttery caramel at the bottom. There was no need to add anything to it. I will make this one Christmas morning next year too.",
