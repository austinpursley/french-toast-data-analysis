            "reviewBody": "Awesome!! Update 03/02/16. I have made this many different ways and just thought I'd let you know. This has become a staple food item in my house. I've tried half 'n half,  heavy cream, and whole milk. Full heavy cream and half 'n half win for texture and creamy taste. Milk got a bit more soggy quickly  but still delicious. I tried using honey instead of maple syrup and almost cried. It's just not the same without the maple. I've used regular sandwich bread and brioche bread (always gluten free, even for non-celieac family memebers) and brioche wins for taste. Adding a touch of cinnamon won't get you arrested and might even get you an extra kiss in the morning (not guaranteed). These freeze well, making your children super happy at midnight after cram sessions before exams and helping out on those mornings when you may have hit the snooze button one too many times. Thanks for the recipe!",

It held up to the waffle maker without getting too flat and smashed.   I did add a little cinnamon to the custard mixture before dipping in the bread.   Big, big hit in my house.

I had a problem with the pieces on the front of my waffle iron -- the lid didn't touch the top of the French toast when I closed the iron, so I just flipped the pieces when I put in the next batch (see pictures). That worked perfectly. I doubled the recipe to use up most of my loaf of French brioche bread, let the extra pieces cool, placed them in ziplock bags, and we'll pop them in the toaster later this week for a quick breakfast. Thank you for a great recipe!",

I used Brioche bread and used butter on the griddle instead of oil.  Perfectly sweet, only needed a little syrup and powdered sugar!  The flour kept it fluffy and not soggy! My kids LOVED it!!",
