Hint: to make peanut butter mix better, I first heated it in the microwave for 30-40 seconds, then added the milk, stirred and microwaved another 20 seconds. Then added the other ingredients, making for a thick, smooth batter.  Served with warm maple syrup.",

You definitely have to melt the peanut butter.  I did add the optional vanilla extract as I always use that when making french toast.  I also added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  I just eyeballed the ingredients, because I've been making french toast for years!  Instead of veg. oil, I used butter.  I never use veg. oil when making french toast.  Overall, this was very good especially with some sliced bananas, a little extra melted peanut butter and some maple syrup on top!",

We did not do so, using the natural peanut butter.  It was difficult to mix the peanut butter with the egg mixture, so our first two pieces had very little pb, but the others were coated.  By the last piece, there were globs of pb coating the toast.  Nothing to complain about if you like pb...Definitely stir batter prior to each dip.   Thanks for the recipe!",

It allows the egg and pb to soak into the bread better, otherwise it is only bread in the middle. After poking holes, super delicious!",

            "reviewBody": "This was very good.  As with other reviewers, I had a hard time keeping the peanut butter mixed into the egg/milk mixture - it just sunk to the bottom and didn't really mix well.  The only substitution I made was I didn't have loaf bread so I used 2 8\" sub rolls cut lengthwise into 3 sections.  They worked well.  I did have enough mixture left over to dunk a couple regular slices of bread and it contained most of the peanut butter - even though I stirred after each dunk.  I didn't feel it had enough of a peanut butter taste - hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.  I believe recipe is a good jumping off point, however.  Next time I will use regular sliced bread and spread the peanut butter on one slice and top with another slice then dunk the whole \"sandwich\" in the egg mixture.  I may even add a little jam to the inside.  Again, a good recipe and a great idea!  I'll be making this again but with changes.  Thanks, Jessiker for the recipe.",

This is one of those recipes that would make a great \"Got Milk\" commercial--make sure you have extra on hand in the frig since it goes so well with the peanut buttery taste.  Let's see, I tried out the maple syrup but definitely preferred garnishing with powdered sugar.  Normally, I love fluffy french toast; the fluffier the better.  But one of these got a little crunchy in the pan and I really think it improved the flavor even more, so I think that next time I will try cooking these in the waffle iron rather than on a pan on the stove.  Might give them a chance at being crunchier and I think that would make them even yummier.  Anyway, thanks for sharing--great recipe!",

The only thing I did differently was to mix the wet ingredients with my electric mixer.  Then I added the peanut butter and also gave it a mix with the electric mixer on high.  It seemed to do the trick.  I did not have the problem that others   mentioned about the peanut butter not mixing in properly.   The toast smelled delicious and tasted delicious.  By the way, did anyone else have extra batter left over.  Perhaps next time I willuse thicker slices of bread.  We ate it with peanut butter on top and slices of bananas.  Yum Yum!!!Thanks for the great tasting meal.",

The peanut butter kept wanting to sink to the bottom and it really didn't mix it well even though I used a whisk and kept stirring it even between bread dippings.

First combine and mix together peanut butter and 1 tablespoon maple syrup; using a kitchen table teaspoon, mix very well until combined and smooth. Keep on mixing, adding more syrup a tablespoon at a time, until peanut butter and syrup have completly combined and smooth in texture; add a little more syrup to give mixture a fairly runny consistancy, but not to runny. You want a consistancy like honey.  Add in 1/2 cup of milk and mix well. Keep on mixing until completly combined and well mixed, add more milk, 1/2 cup at a time (3 cups total); mixing well till completly combined, smooth and all one color.  In a seperate small bowl, beat eggs well; combine with peanut butter/millk mixture. Add in rest of ingredients. Mix well.  Heat griddle to 300F; coat griddle with a thin oil coating.  Dunk each slice of bread in peanut butter/egg mixture, soaking both sides. Place on griddle and cook on both sides until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot with butter, sliced bananas, and maple syrup.  Be sure to keep your peanut butter/egg mixture well stired at all times.  Enjoy.",

I had never thought about adding cinnamon. That IS the key (next to vanilla). It adds a very nice taste. Since I like the taste of egg, I cut the milk to 1/4c and add pinch of salt &amp; pepper, (if you omit the pb), but again, that's my taste. I also had to cut the white sugar to only 1 T, otherwise too sweet for me.

Or better yet I might cut up some french bread and bake it all in the oven.  But I will definitely try this recipe again.",
