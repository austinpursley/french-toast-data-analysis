            "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe that is much requested at family gatherings. I make a couple of changes as follows: I use 1/2 teaspoon orange extract in place of the liqueur or omit it entirely - you won't really miss it. Use challah or Hawaiian sweet bread instead of french bread. Don't bother to remove the crusts and pack your pan tightly with bread pieces cut 1\" thick to absorb the excess liquid. (I use almost an entire loaf of challah for one pan.) Melt the butter in the microwave, stir in the brown sugar and corn syrup and then pour into the pan. The sugar will dissolve during the baking process. No need to bring the pan to room temperature before baking. Invert the pieces as you serve them. The brown sugar mixture is a substitute for syrup, don't use additional syrup when you serve or it will be too sweet.",

            "reviewBody": "This was a delicious recipe that I made for Easter brunch.  We all loved it, and overall I would make it again for a weekend treat.  Perfect for make-ahead night before.  I read ALL the reviews before I proceeded and combined all the wonderful suggestions, as I beleive that helped make this recipe even better.  I used a large loaf of 2-day old French bread and left crusts on --- this is soooo key, and especially helpful in \"flipping\" half-way through baking (you MUST to this to saturate the bread fully, otherwise too eggy as others warned), and then again at the end before broiling to get the caramel sauce nice and brown and bubbly.  If you left the crusts OFF, I beleive it would be too soggy and not as \"chewy\".  I made it with 4 egss, and thought it turned out great.  I used 1 TBL vanilla vs 1 tsp.  The Grand Marnier is a must, or do something to bring out the orange flavor even more (I will add orange zest next time in additon to a TBL more of GM).  I did add cinnamon to egg mixture  before dipping each slice of bread into it.  Then, I poured the remaining egg mixture over the entire thing before putting in fridge overnight.  I used 1 TBL maple syrup v. corn syrup (liked this!!).  Served with slices of strawberries for more elegant presentation (will do seasonal berry for future).  I used about 8 slices of bread per pan (vs 6) at LEAST 1 inch thick is a must as well, and liked having these individual servings when flipping and plating.  I also like the idea of using a Frenc",

I had no problem with sogginess, I really think the key is to use stale bread (mine was 2 days old).\nMine turned out a bit eggy, but I think maybe that was my fault - I didn't beat the eggs enough.  But it was pretty and fluffy when it was finished.  Still, I'm considering cutting out one of the eggs the next time I make it.\nI did make some changes though.  I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and only 1 tblsp of corn syrup.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness.  I didn't bother to remove the crust from the bread.  It's not necessary.\nAlso, to all of those people who are leaving out the Grand Marnier, you are missing the point... the orange flavor is what gives this its Creme Brulee taste!  As for me, I decided to use 1/2 tsp. of orange extract instead and that did the trick for me.  Just a hint of citrus, much like Creme Brulee.\nI cooked it for about 37 minutes and it came out perfectly.  It was a practice run for a shower brunch I'm throwing, &amp; I'll definitely leave it on the menu.",

To make it thick, I had two layers of bread (I\u2019ve also used 3 layers and put \u201cstuff\u201d between the layers\u2026cream cheese w/ jam, etc\u2026).   I put the brown sugar mixture down first (as it says in the directions), then a layer of bread, I poured about a cup of the milk/egg mixture on top to wet the bread, another layer of bread &amp; milk/egg mixture, and the final layer of bread and the rest of the milk/egg.   I let it set about 12 hours in the refrigerator.   It made a FULL 9x13. \n\n-I\u2019ve also substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup.",

I made some small changes as suggested by other reviewers:  I left the crust on the bread (I used italian b/c my store was out of french bread so I did use 6 slices) and I only used 4 eggs.  I soaked each piece of bread in egg/half and half mixture for a minute each side and then just poured the leftover mixture over the entire pan.  I did not cook butter/brown sugar/corn syrup, I just mixed sugar into melted butter. It seemed a little gritty to me, so next time I will make sure to fully dissolve the brown sugar before I pour it into the pan.  After baking I also flipped them over and put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes (I used a metal pan, NOT a glass one) I highly recommend doing this, it seemed to caramelize/thicken the glaze.

Instead of pouring the egg mixture over the bread cubes, I stirred them all together in a bowl until the bread was all coated, eliminating the need for the flipping suggested by some reviewers. The only problem I had was it took about 10 minutes longer to bake -- after the suggested time, it just looked like soggy bread in a pan. I decided to leave it in for a little while to try to get a golden brown color to make it more appetizing. After 10 more minutes it had puffed up beatifully, was a lovely golden brown and was cooked through.",

I substitute maple syrup for the corn syrup and sprinkle cinnamon on the top before baking.  Also, when making it for people that are watching their fat and calories, I substitute egg beaters for the eggs and either milk or fat free 1/2 &amp; 1/2 for the regular 1/2 &amp; 1/2.  Having made this for 3 different groups now, and getting all rave reviews, I am confident in highly recommending this recipe.",

I wish  my grocery stores carried bricohe bread, but they don't,so I use that extra thick french toast bread in pkg and works fine. I squeeeze the bread slices in and get about 8 in a pan over the syrup before I pour  the egg liquid over  the top. I use  grand marnier &amp; I use more than called for - its a keeper recipe for sure!",

Also I didn't prepare overnight, I coated the bread with the sugar mixture on both side and let it sit in the EggNog, egg, and orange juice mixture for 15 minutes. Cooked french toast on the stove top and then cook the left over Egg Nog Mixture seperately and put ontop of French Toast. It was divine.",

I'd use one less egg next time. If you want the bottom of your pan coated in that nice syrup/toffee mix, then you should use the stated amounts of butter and brown sugar. I baked for 20 min. and then broiled until browned on top. My wife who was about go jogging tried a mouthful and almost cancelled her running plans. But when she got back, she ate 2 pieces! Keeps well warmed in the oven on low heat. Nice recipe for company.",

I also bought a whole loaf of French bread and cut it myself so I could get nice big slices. I took some other reviewer's suggestions and added orange zest and some of the juice (made it EXTRA delicious) and substituted real maple syrup for the corn syrup. I don't have corn syrup and it just made sense.  This was a really delicious breakfast but it IS VERY RICH (which is really why it's such a treat). You don't need syrup for the top and I would suggest serving it with some fruit and breakfast meat on the side. I think that if you were to completely fill up on this french toast, you may have a tummy ache later.",

It didn't  totally ruin the dish though, after baking, I flipped each piece over in the pan so the tops were moist--and the flavor was wonderful.  The important thing is that it made me realize why there were so many varying degrees of success with this recipe:  It's not that there are too many eggs or too much milk or anything faulty with the recipe.  It's the bread.  I'm reading that some have used  pre-sliced sourdough--I know the bread, and it's MAYBE 1/2\" thick.  The bread/liquid ratio is off, leaving a soggy, soupy mess.  Others are using roughly 1 to 1-1/4\" slices with great success.  Me?  I LOVE big, fat slices of French bread for my French toast, so I cut my slices at least 2\" thick, making the bread to liquid ratio off again, only in the opposite direction.  Mine was dry.  To make matters worse, I had company for the weekend and wanted to make sure that I had enough French toast to serve for breakfast, so I squished and squeezed and pushed and pinched every slice of an entire loaf of bread into my 9\"x13\"--until I thought it was going to spring up and hit me in the face.  Rookie move!  I should have known better, but after enjoying the beautiful flavor of the dish, I know now that I can have my 2\" giant slices, I just need to adjust the liquids to accommodate that preference.  I may have to make it 2 mo",

Both of them attended Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in Paris and work as chefs.  Well, we all loved this!  I used a 2-day-old loaf of grocery store French bread and left on the crusts.  I sliced it into about 1\"-1 1/2\" slices.  I didn't get this made the night before because, quite frankly, I was exhausted from holiday activities that day.  So, I mixed it up in the morning, soaking each slice of bread in the egg batter before cramming as many as I could into the 13 X 9 pan.  I poured what was left of the batter over the slices, and let it all sit in the refrigerator for about an hour. Before baking, I sprinkled on a little cinnamon.  I flipped the slices over to serve with the yummy caramel syrup on top.  I thought this was perfect as written, but I may try some other reviewers suggestions in the future for variety, such as mixing chopped pecans in with the syrup mixture or using maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  It was excellent served with sausage links and fresh fruit. ",

The overall taste was very good though.  The Grand Marnier was undetectable and I would probably not bother with it next time, unless I added some orange zest or something to highlight the orange flavor. It was great to be able to make this the night before. I didn't have any sogginess problems that other people complained about. As long as you use day old (I used 2 day old) bread, you will be fine. Everyone at my brunch loved this and most people had seconds. Except for the sweetness, this did not taste as heavy as I was expecting it to considering the ingredients, which pleasantly surprised me. Overall the taste was great and made the house smell heavenly.",

I just omitted it all together. The french toast was a hit when I made it! Everyone loved it and begged for more. It's an easy recipe and I'm glad I made it! I was asked to make it again the next morning because it was that good! I did change the recipe to 1 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of reduced milk. It was still great and decadent.

The bread was uneatably (don't think that's a word) soggy and I basically told my family that they were eating yogurt &amp; fruit for breakfast. I will never attempt to make this again... I have no clue why so many people like it. If you still choose to make this, be sure to use all 5 eggs, possibly 6 and be prepared to cook it for longer... more like 45 minutes. I don't think the half &amp; half added much so I would use whole milk instead.",

It is easy to put together so I'll make it for Christmas morning for sure now. I didn't have half and half but I had heavy whipping cream so I used a cup of that and half a cup of milk.  I also used normal bread slices.  I ended up using 8 slices.  Two of them were cut into smaller pieces and squeezed into every possible area in the pan!   It turned out well.  I did skip the orange liquor but next time I'll be sure to put orange extract to make it taste more like my favorite dessert as others have suggested.  Thank you so much for this recipe:).",

I was able to get 8 thick slices from my loaf and they fit in the dish just fine. If you do not have Grand Marnier or do not wish to use alcohol, you can substitute with orange extract (I did!) and it was perfect. Instead of corn syrup, I used pure maple syrup.

It makes a very pretty presentation though once inverted and the carmelized top is exposed.  I would say if you don't mind the sweetness (which I don't) reduce the eggs to 3, and follow everything else to the letter, it will make a very good (and it is very easy to prepare!) breakfast treat.",

I made a couple of modifications - once the French toast is finished cooking, flip the individual pieces over and put it under the broiler to crisp it up - keeps it from being soggy and makes it more like creme brulee. I also toast sliced almonds separately and use that as a topping once the baking is complete. It's great with different toppings served on the side - cinnamon apples or sweetened strawberries are great with it. We don't remove the crusts, and it still comes out fabulously. This one is definitely a keeper. Bacon makes a great complement to the sweetness.",

Used sourdough bread with crust on, Splenda mix brown sugar, salted butter (and then did not add more salt), 1/2 cup nonfat milk and 1/2 cup half and half, sugar free maple syrup instead of the corn syrup, and 4 eggs.  I definitely agree with those who say 5 eggs and 1 1/2 cup half and half is too much liquid.  I was not able to get the topping crunchy like a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e even though I did flip it and put it under the broiler as many suggested.
