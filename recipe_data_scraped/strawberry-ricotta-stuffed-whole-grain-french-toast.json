I am not sure how you are supposed to flip these without the insides falling out - we used toothpicks to hold the sandwiches together while cooking. Also, I think you can reduce the number of eggs for dipping - we had tons of leftover egg/milk mixture. I think you'd be fine with three instead of the recommended four. We'll make these again with some modification.",

I used a day-old whole wheat I had on hand and chopped the strawberries VERY fine. My kids liked this, I cut the recipe in half just for them. I had a hard time keeping the filling inside the french toast. I think next time, instead of using granulated sugar, I might use powdered. It might thicken up the mixture and make it have a little sticking power.",

I made this as written, using buttermilk. I had a feeling the milk/egg mixture would make too much, so started with half the amount, and it was perfect as I had just enough for the four servings. Topped with berry honey butter, syrup and whipped cream on top for a perfect Mother's Day breakfast.",

I had a little bit of frozen mixed berries so I used them up.  For the rest I used a low-sugar strawberry jam.  We topped them with Redi-Whip and they were a hit!  These can be made with almost any kind of bread and fruits.  Experiment and enjoy!",
