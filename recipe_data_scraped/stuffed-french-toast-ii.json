    "description": "This is a nice change from ordinary French toast. I make this more than the standard recipe.  Although this is my family's favorite version, it is very versatile. You can substitute peanut butter for the cream cheese, use different jams or preserves, different extracts or spices - the options are practically limitless! Serve with maple syrup and sprinkle with powdered sugar.",

I also substituted strawberry jam for the raspberry jam.  Next time I would like to try substituting mascarpone for the cream cheese and trying different extracts, maybe adding a little more than called for.  Also, if you use fat free cream cheese, it will harden up a bit and almost seem curdled.",

I used grape jelly (it's what we had), 3 eggs (I only used 6 slices of bread), potato bread (again, it's what we had and it worked GREAT), vanilla extract instead of almond, and also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the milk/egg mixture.  Oh and I used 2 Tbs butter.  I know I made a lot of changes, but this recipe gave me a great start and I loved how mine turned out!  The cinnamon and nutmeg were a GREAT addition.  My husband said it tasted like something you would get at a fancy Bed and Breakfast :-)",

It tasted like a combination of a strudel and apple pie!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly for the batter, I just did what I normally do which is 4 eggs, a splash of milk, and a dash each of cinnamon and vanilla extract. I also didn't have any bread sturdier than white, so I used that. I would recommend something a little heartier, just because the white bread didn't hold up very well during the spreading and dipping, but it was still the best french toast I've ever eaten!! ",

I let the sandwiches soak a minute or so in the egg mixture, otherwise they turn out too dry for my tastes if I do a quick dip. I'm not a big fan of sweet breakfasts, so this is right up my alley. Not very sweet at all! The almond extract is a nice touch! The last time I made this, I topped the french toast with strawberries that were macerated with a bit of brown sugar and amaretto. SO GOOD!!!",

If I could make one suggestion though....I did as the recipe said, spread cream cheese on one slice and the jam of your choice on the other. Next time I make this (which I was immediately informed would be in a couple days again) I will mix the jam &amp; cream cheese together first &amp; then spread in between the bread slices. I was blessed to have fresh strawberry jam from a friend so the flavor was delicious. I served it with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup from this site. I've had this at a fancy breakfast cafe near our house and always have cravings for it but can't afford it very often. Now I can make it at home and have seconds without paying for a second plate. YES. It really is that good.",
