            "reviewBody": "This was wonderful! :) You can make it with any cheese or any herbs (like cheddar and a mexican blend of spices)! I will make this often with a couple adjustments: Use minced garlic or thinly slice the garlic so it mostly melts away while you saute in oil (I used olive oil); add 1 teaspoon of basil and 1 teaspoon of Nature's Seasoning (or salt); Beat eggs, set aside, then start heating the oil and garlic before you dip the sandwich; then right before frying, dip the sandwich and cook on medium until golden brown on one side (There's no easier way to dip it into the egg mixture other than with your hands so just do it - it's worth it); flip, and cook the other side until golden brown.  Cooking it slower on medium assures that the center won't be mushy when the outside is golden brown.  Try it!",

To give the recipe a little oomf, I used dried oregano in the egg mixture, and added some fresh basil with the mozzarella.  I chose a little left over baguette (that was incredible) that I wanted to use.  To make sure the dish was cook through-out, I covered the pan as it was cooking.  It was a nice lunch that was perfect served with a glass of red wine.",
