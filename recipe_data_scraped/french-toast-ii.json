They fiddle and fuss and screw around and somehow- somehow- it's never as good as the stuff they get at that little place down the street. \n\nWell. Having worked for a succession of little places down the street? This is the sort of recipe they use. Simple, made fresh and a la moment. \n\nIn fact, with the addition of a splash of orange extract and a coating of Panko crumbs before frying, this is so close to the recipe for which I used to get raves- and which travelled with me through three kitchens- as to be indistinquishable. Good stuff- brown and crunchy on the outside, rich and custardy inside.\n\nI would suggest using French bread- supermarket variety is fine- and using any left overs to make a first class grilled ham and cheese for lunch.

To combat the sogginess of the toast, I dried the bread out in the over on 200 degrees for about 10 or 15 minutes, flipping them periodically.  I could have left them out overnight to achieve the same results if I had planned ahead.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture, and sprinkled the finished product with powered sugar and cinnamon.  I found I didn't need much maple syrup because the toast has good flavor all on its own.",

By the time you are ready to start serving you will have fully cooked french toast. If you are making a small batch (i.e for one or two); you can always pop these into the toaster (after they have been cooked through in a pan/griddle) if you think they need to be cooked a little more. On a side note: these freeze and reheat well in the toaster and leave your kitchen smelling wonderful. Also if you know you don't like nutmeg, or you are cooking for a \"picky eater\" cut back on the nutmeg! .....I add vanilla to this recipe because well I put vanilla in just about everything. Overall a great recipe easy to customize after you make it the first time. (i've always mixed the cinnamon in with the egg even though it gets a little clumpy but if you mix well and swirl it before you dip the bread it makes a lovely dark swirl on the bread). -Happy baking!",

The nutmeg was lovely. We couldn't tell that it was made with brown sugar. We used a very dense home-made white loaf and it worked very well. With the denser bread the slices we soaked for longer were creamier and more flavourful. We fried some slices in butter and felt the added salt and richness made it tastier. If I made it again I would add butter and perhaps vanilla to the batter, and if it were still bland add syrup. ",

I usually add a little regular milk, (but not too much, as my husband doesn't KNOW I do it... )Today, I didnt have any milk and used french vanilla coffee creamer and the brown sugar.. The cook time seemed longer, and I wasnt sure it was cooked through, and as i turned up the heat, the sugar caused my french toast to start to burn... Mind you, my husband likes his french toast JUST SO, so i was VERY light on the sugar!!! I cooked 8 pieces of french toast (needed 6 eggs for this) and while we both scarfed most of it down, I prefer the old way-- the brown sugar didnt add anything in my opinion, and if you are usually maple syrup anyhow, the flavor is in there, without having to burn it while cooking... We DID eat it, and coffeemate may have attributed to the burning, but I thought I would mention this anyway..",

In the batter i added slightly more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe called for, and like some other reviewers, i added some vanilla. I also added some unsweetened shedded coconut. It was a nice, quick breakfast. It's super tasty served with freshly cut strawberries and bananas, and mapple syrup :)",

Had exactly enough for 2 slices of bread which was what I wanted to begin with. Turned out really well and the little bit of chocolate gave it the perfect taste. Looks like I need to hit the store for brown sugar and nutmeg though- can't live without my staples. Overall a great base recipe- I just don't follow recipes well.",

The only things keeping this from getting five stars are: (1) Perhaps I am soaking my bread too long, but there is no way I could get 12 pieces of bread dipped with the the amount of batter the recipe makes. I usually only get about 6 slices. (2) The recipe doesn't specify how long to cook other than until brown. It was a trial and error process the first time I made these to get toast that wasn't soggy. I have found medium-low heat for about 4 minutes on each side produces perfect toast.",
