Texas Toast works wonderfully for this recipe - 6 slices (which look pretty halved on the diagonal) fit perfectly into the 9x13 pan.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the cranberries to 3/4 cup.  As recommended by another reviewers, I let the dish sit overnight with some soda cans on top to help the bread soak up the egg.  I found that it helps to spray the aluminum foil cover with cooking spray before baking, else the bread puffs up and sticks to the  foil.  I also baked for much longer than  called for -- 1 hour  covered and ten minutes uncovered. We will make this again and again!",

I have made it for my parents and in-laws, and they've all loved it.  I used a loaf of bakery Italian bread, which I cubed to allow the bread to soak up the egg more easily and to make it easier to serve when finished. I let the cubed bread dry out a bit before mixing in the egg since that seems that very fresh bread gets doughy after it sits in the egg overnight.  Granny Smith apples work well for me.  For more tang, I suggest dried cherries instead of dried cranberries.",

I inverted the whole thing on a platter as suggested, and it was beautiful.  I will definitely keep making this.

Once out of the casserole, I topped with some maple syrup and broiled for just a minute or two to carmalize the top. I then sprinkled with a bit of powdered sugar.

It was nice to make it the night before &amp; just pop it in the oven before my guests arrived.  I used a sugar free brown sugar substitute.  As my husband thought it was a little too sweet, I might experiment &amp; make it using 3/4 cup brown sugar next time.  I used whole wheat bread to make it more nutritious &amp; also cut the bread into about one inch cubes (keeping the crust on), instead of leaving the bread in slices.  My other tip is to make sure you have enough of the egg mixture to moisten the bread.  I thought it was too dry so I added more egg mixture.  Depending on how many slices of bread you use, my guess would be to use about one egg for about one and a half pieces of bread.",
