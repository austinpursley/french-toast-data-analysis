Depending on the size bread you use, however, you may need more than the number of pans indicated. I doubled the recipe and ended up using about 6 pans. I was worried the bread would not be coated enough but it baked up light and fluffy and every piece tasted fantastic. The syrup is VERY sweet. A little goes a long way! ",

I always set out powdered sugar in a sifter on a plate, and the kids love sprinkling their sugar on top.  Then comes the praline syrup - not to be missed!

After 20 minutes in oven, I poured the sauce over and baked for an additional five minutes.  It felt weird not using my usual Almond extract, but the Rum was a welcomed change!

I think the trick to not getting gooey in the middle toast is to use bread that is not overly thick and maybe cook a little longer.  I froze several pyrex dishes full and this is a super, quick easy breakfast for those hectic mornings.  I've cooked them from frozen and thawed.  Both work but should probably thaw first to avoid cracking the pyrex glass.  I was lucky.  I haven't had time to try the praline syrup.  We use real Canadian Maple Syrup on all of our pancakes and french toasts.  I like just yogurt or salsa sauce on mine which my family  thinks  is just weird!",

I also sprinkled cinnamon on the toast before baking it. I didn't make the syrup, just used maple syrup that I had on hand. I also used half and half, decided that heavy cream would be to much.

The difference is her recipe calls for baking the praline topping on the french toast:\nThe next day, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. \n\nSpread Praline Topping evenly over the bread and bake for 40 minutes, until puffed and lightly golden. Serve with maple syrup",
