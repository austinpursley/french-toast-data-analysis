It made 4 slices so I added a couple more eggs and milk with a dash of syrup and made 2 more. It came out nicely crisp and moist. French toast is always made best with day old or drier bread.",

I doubled the mix and put like 7 pieces of bread in and it soaked the ENTIRE MIX UP. So if you need to double or can\u2019t fit all of your pieces in the batter at once you really need to portion the mix out. I am sure the fact that the pieces soaked up all of that mix significantly affected the flavor so I can only give this 2 stars.",

Didn\u2019t use cornflakes because I didn\u2019t have them, but it was still delicious!  Only dipped the bread in the egg mixture for a couple of seconds on each side rather than soaking them.  Fried them in melted butter and poured maple syrup on top.  It was more like dessert and so very delicious!",
