            "reviewBody": "This was excellent!  We don't keep pina colada mix on hand, so I opted to use a combination of coconut milk and pineapple juice for the mix...and I kept forgetting to pick up pineapple juice, so in the end, I opened a can of crushed pineapple and use some of that juice.  A few of the pineapple bits poured out and I liked the result of teeny bits of fruit on the finished product.  My only other change was to use a Portuguese Saloio Bread, kind of dense, chewy, tiny hint of sweetness, and that paired beautifully with the pina colada flavors, as well as being a great \"French toast\" bread!  I did experiment by sprinkling a couple of the dipped slices of bread with some shredded coconut before pan-frying, but some pieces burned a bit, so next time I'll just have toasted coconut to offer as an additional topping.  Wonderful summery breakfast idea! Thanks, laughingmagpie!",

The bananas seemed a little out of place to me and I think I would prefer garnishing it with pineapple and most definitely coconut,  but hubby thought they were just fine with the bananas.   I only used 6 eggs in the egg dip because 8 just seemed like a lot, but I measured everything else the same.",

Only needed 5 eggs and used 1/2 cup each of milk &amp; mix (next time will use more mix).  I addeed a few drops of coconut extract and a few chunks of canned pineapple with about 2 tbsp. of pineapple juice.  Put it in the blender for a a really smooth batter.  Served topped with a slice of bacon and a pineapple ring - a definite keeper!",

This only needs fresh fruit for a topping and not syrup. I got 20 slices of Texas Toast from this recipe. I individually froze and stacked it back in the bread sack for a quick breakfast treat. Magpie - so glad you came up with this recipe.  UPDATE:  I originally made this in June when it was a personal recipe.  I have since made it 3 times.  It freezes well and heats up great in the toaster or the microwave.",
