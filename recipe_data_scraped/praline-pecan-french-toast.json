I made the French toast exactly as is the night before I served it, warmed up the pralines syrup mixture, spooned on top of the bread, and baked it.  It was grand. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  My family raved about it for ten minutes; they could not stop talking about how good it was.  I paired this dish with the brunch egg bake that I also found on this site.  It was a wonderful brinner to put the two together!  I'm so, so glad I tried this recipe.",
