Next time, I half the recipe but I assure you, I will make this again. Thanks Kerry!",

I think we will next try the cream cheese mixed with peanut butter and mini chocolate chips.  Mabye then the kids will eat french toast.  This is a wonderful breakfast grilled cheese type sandwich and would be perfect at a brunch!!",

I Love the recipe for the cream cheese stuffing, but I'm afraid that a simple (very simple) egg batter just isn't enough for me. Luckily, I used left over cinnamon bread to make these, otherwise  I know all I would have tasted was the filling and the egg. Next time I will use a heartier batter, and probably a thicker bread that I can actually stuff rather than sandwich. I will also use clarified butter rather than strait butter for the frying.

            "reviewBody": "I was looking for a stuffed French toast recipe for Father's Day and wanted one that didn't use fruit (my one daughter won't eat it.)  After reading the reviews I chose this recipe and added only 1/2 of the the brown sugar it called for.  After tasting the cream cheese mixture, I added the remaining brown sugar, it didn't seem sweet enough with only 1/2 of what was called for.    I spread the cream cheese on the bread to what I thought looked like a \"good\" amount.  In the end I ended up with a total of six sandwiches instead of four.  I think by using less spread on each sandwich it balanced out the sweetness that other reviewers commented on.  The French toast came out really nice, definitely plenty of cream cheese in the middle, I think any more and it would have been a mess to try to cut through.  The spices give it a nice taste, especially the allspice.  If you're not a big fan of allspice you may want to cut back on it or omit it altogether as you will taste it.  The whole family enjoyed the recipe as is, with the exception of using less spread per sandwich.  There is plenty of egg mixture for 6 sandwiches too, and I even let them soak for awhile, so there is no need to make extra if you use a few extra slices of bread.  Will make again, thanks.",

I think it would be a nice addition to a brunch with other non-sweet food, i.e. bacon, eggs, etc.  I had mine with strong, black coffee and that kind of helped with the sweetness.

I used pumpkin pie spice, which was easier to toss around than each individual spice.  I also sprinkled Splenda on top instead of powdered sugar (that's all I had in the cupboard!) which had the same pretty effect.  Thanks for this idea, will make again!",

I used wheat bread, it was all I had, so I would use white bread or something else next time. I also thought there was too much cream cheese, so I would cut down next time to maybe half a cup.  Otherwise - tasty!",

And preparation is easy too since no pockets have to be cut and the bread stuffed.  I mixed some warm water with orange marmalade and drizzled it on top.  Mmmmmm.",
