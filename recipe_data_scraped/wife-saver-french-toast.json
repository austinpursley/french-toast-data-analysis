However I could only fit 6 slices of bread in the pan, they were pretty big slices and I had to squeeze them to fit.  That being said, I felt there was way too much milk.  The bread was really wet after baking.  It had really great flavor and the house smelled wonderful while baking.  I may try again using less milk and maybe more egg.",

I had to tweak the recipe a little because I only had a demi loaf of day old French bread.  I was able to get 8 small 1 inch slices out of the loaf.  I was going to halve the recipe but ended up just tweaking it a little.  Here are the changes I made: 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c light corn syrup, 8 slices of french bread, 1 3/4 c 2% milk.  Everything else I left the same.  I baked it in an 8x8 glass baking dish.  I mixed together the cinnamon and sugar mixture but ended up only using a little over half because that seems like enough.  I baked 50 mins and it came out of the oven perfect!  My husband loved it, so I will be making this again in the future!",

I didn't have time to let it set over night becuase my kids were hungry now,of course! But I really wanted to try this one.  I followed the recipe and cooked the brown sugar, etc.  Instead of pouring the egg mixture over the bread, I continued to make regular french toast on the stove.  I tol some of the brown sugar mixture and spread it in a skillet, dunked the bread into the egg mixture and put it in the skillet and cooked as usual.  It still turned out wonderful!  I can't wait to plan ahead and make it in the over to see the difference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

It was so sticky that it stuck to your teeth and very hard to cut up because it stuck to the plate as well. I didnt use the 1/2 cup it called for just about a quarter cup. It did have a great flavor, just not easy to eat. Maybe next time will leave it out altogether. Also took some others advice and cut back on the milk. Cut it in half (1 1/4 cup) and stiil was just a tad to mushy. Need to cut it back alittle more. It has a great flavor and all but need to figure out the corn syrup ratio so it isnt so gummy.",

I even drained the pans before cooking. I also lowered the temp to 325* and cooked for longer hoping it would crisp it up better.   So for the mushy aspect I had to give it 4 stars. \nAlso, I cooked it in 2 glass pans and one foil pan, the foil pan was the least sticking of the batches.",
