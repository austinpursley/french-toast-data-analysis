First, I tear up 12 slices of cinnamon swirl bread instead of the French bread and put into the 13x9 pan then I pour the cream mixture over the bread and stir until the bread soaks it up. Then I bake it in a 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes, or until it is crisp. It is sooo yummy!\nI often make up a few and keep them uncooked in the freezer. When I am ready to use one, I pull it out and let it thaw and bake as normal! We have it every Christmas morning.",

I mixed the liquid ingredients in a jelly roll pan and the sugar easily disolved with no mess.

Make sure you cut the bread in thick slices and let it soak for the full 5 minutes, if you don't the orange flavor doesn't infuse very well.  My kids, 4 &amp; 3, both ate THREE pieces of this french toast they loved it that much.  I was able to cook the whole loaf of bread on my electric griddle.",

I found I fried them for nearly 10 minutes per side, trying to get them less mushy, but to no avail. My husband said maybe had I cut the bread much thinner perhaps it would have worked better. I might have to play with the recipe, because I really did like the  taste, but no one in our family could eat theirs because they  were so raw they practically liquified in the middle. sorry :(",

Alternatively, I appreciate the measurements, as i'm not an intuitive cook like the rest of the matriarchs in my family who just eyeball everything .  \n\n1st   You have to actually whisk the batter completely in a mixing bowl before soaking the bread in it.  How else will you marry the flavors.  you can also make the mixture a day ahead of time and refrigerate it.\n\n2nd  we only use fresh ingredients:  i.e..  we don't use ground spices unless we have to.  therefore we grate a cinnamon stick and nutmeg berry.  also we squeeze fresh oranges into the mixture and zest orange peel into it.  about a tablespoon.\n\n3rd  A quality maple syrup will bring out the orange flavor.   it's supposed to be a pleasant surprise.  Also if made properly, the heavy cream is worth the calories.\n\nalso if you are watching calories, french toast is not for you...lol.  enjoy!",

(maybe less)\n- a bit more cinnamon &amp; nutmeg (be careful with the nutmeg, of course)\n-2 tsp. vanilla\n------------------------------------\nWith whisk, beat all ingredients in bowl(except butter &amp; powdered sugar). Then place in 9 x 13 inch pan.  Add the bread - turn it over - make sure evenly soaked - all liquid will soak up. and NOT be too soggy.\n\nEverything else was the same as original recipe.\nI look forward to trying it as it is supposed to be because it got such great reviews but seriously, I am very happy with the version I ended up with as well!  Yumyum!",

I put just a touch of pure maple syrup on mine, but it would be good plain too.  Served with thick-cut bacon and fresh peaches.  Thanks for the recipe!",
