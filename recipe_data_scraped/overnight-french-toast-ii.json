It was very convenient to simply pop it in the \r\r\r\noven, and the tops of the slices browned and crisped very nicely.\r\r\r\nHowever, the lower half of every slice was a soggy mess.  The butter\r\r\r\nand brown sugar layer at the bottom tasted great, a nice alternative\r\r\r\nto serving with syrup, but I would cut the amounts by half next time.  \r\r\r\nAlso, I'd leave out at least one egg.  I substituted maple syrup \r\r\r\nfor the corn syrup for a richer flavor.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI didn't care for this recipe that much, but the four guys I live\r\r\r\nwith all gave it rave reviews...go figure!

To my hubby and children's delight, I made an executive decision to have Christmas at home. Everyone asked me to make a huge breakfast and this recipe was part of my menu. I can't tell you how much this was loved! I used challah bread, only soaked for about an hour and a half, didn't use the corn syrup, added lots of cinnamon and because I had it around for the holiday, I replaced the milk with eggnog. Once done, I turned the  casserole upside down onto a dish. The caramalized sauce ran all down the sides and looked really pretty. Thanks Sarah for a great recipe that didn't even taste like french toast; more like a very yummy gooey pastry. Delicious!",

There were many complaints about this recipe, but I didn't have any problems.  Here are some things I did do that weren't clear in the directions....I used the whole loaf of bread making a double layer.  I doubled the syrup recipe, pouring most of it on the bottom and a little in between layers, but not using all of it just in case it would be too sweet.  I did not time the baking, I just kept checking on it while the kids opened their Christmas presents, but I really don't think it took too much time....maybe a little over the recommended 45 minutes.  I just watched it till the top started to brown.  It was not mushy, or too sweet...I really think it was just right.   I did use a Pampered Chef stoneware baking dish, maybe that's why I didn't have any problems with the syrup getting hard after it cooled.  I hate to say it, but I like this recipe better than my mom's!",

I actually use Texas Toast and layer the ingredients in my 9 x 13 glass Pyrex. 1/2 sugar mixture goes on the bottom, then a layer of bread, then 1/2 egg mixture. I put most of the remaining sugar mixture on top of that, and repeat with the bread and remaining egg mixture. I end up with a dollop of the sugar mixture on each piece of egg-soaked bread and refrigerate. I've never had a problem with hardening sugar on the bottom of the pan this way.

A few more changes I made were adding cinnamon to the egg mixture and replaced regular milk with Almond milk.    After I put the sugar mixture in the pan I sliced a banana and gently set a layer of bananas on top of it.  I used fresh Italian bread and sliced it about an inch thick (about 5 slices fit in the dish).  Baked it on 350 for about 40 minutes.  My daughter said it was awesome and I thought so too.  It was not mushy and the crust was so chewy and delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  Oh and we DID use a little maple syrup on top but it did not need much so apparently it wasn't too sweet for us. :)",

We both loved it but it is not exactly the same as regular french toast if that is what you are expecting. In my opinion, I like this even better than traditional french toast.",

I do not use corn syrup (because I don't want to buy it) and just use syrup in it's place....very good.  I add a teaspoon of cinnamon.  You don't even need additional syrup when eating.\r\n\r\nUpdate:  I have made this countless number of times, including for cooking club.  It is ALWAYS a huge hit and I constantly get asked for the recipe.  \r\n\r\nChallah bread makes this dish AMAZING!  I couldn't find any French bread at the grocery store so the baker suggested this.  He told me to double the egg and milk mixture though since it soaks up a lot more liquid than regular French bread.  I decided to multiply the egg and milk mixture by about 1.5 and it was perfect!  I still make this with regular bread but the challah bread is so much better.  I have actually made this recipe (just for my husband and I) with hoagies that had been in the freezer too long and it was still great.  A continued favorite!",

I also split the sugar mixture and used 3/4 of the liquid on the bottom of the pan and the remaining on top so that it was sweeter throughout.  \nThis would be really good with a little bourbon added too.  \nLike before I adjusted the eggs and milk to accommodate the smaller portion and baked in a 9x4 bread pan. \n\nYou must adjust this recipe based on how much bread and the dryness of the bread that you are using. Like others mentioned I cooked mine covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for 10 to prevent drying. I only had half an old loaf of French bread so I cut the eggs and mink in half and it was delicious.",

I also let it sit only for an hour in the fridge before baking.  Whole family loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.",

Added 2 extra eggs (personal preference) and 1 tsp cinnamon to the egg mix. I layered the sugar and egg mixes and soaked overnight. Baked up wonderfully with a crunchy sweet topping and was not soggy in the least. I think the stale thick bread is the key. (It's what a chef friend of mine uses to make his bread pudding) A very versatile recipe that can accommodate any leftover breads. Raisins, nuts or possibly even berries could be added for a change up. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for my leftover breads. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I should tell you that I read all of the reviews and was a little hesitant about serving the hot meal to my toddlers, but quickly realized that my french toast was not hardening like everyone warned.  The only thing I can think of is that I cooked the syrup, butter and brown sugar for a longer period of time on low heat to ensure that the sugar crystals melted.  Once I was done cooking this mixture, it was like a caramel sauce.  That's the only thing I did differently.  Hope this helps...great recipe!",

Good if you don't want to use cream like some of the other baked french toast recipes on the site, but I think I'd still prefer using those recipes with the cream omitted, over this one.

Very slight changes: substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup, egg nog for the milk and I added 2 tsp cinnamon to the custard.  For serving, I inverted the French Toast onto a serving serving platter - there was no problem with the sauce hardening.  Like another reviewer I made the Oats N Honey bread just for this recipe.  Delicious - I'll be using this recipe again soon. Thanks for posting BOBSROAD",

I thought it was pretty good, wasn't thrilled with the flavor - thought it needed maple syrup instead of corn syrup and definitely cinnamon too. I followed the recipe exactly for the first time making it though. My husband and son both loved it though - my hubby had never had overnight French toast and I think he was very pleasantly surprised! The crisp edges are a nice contrast to the moist and tender center pieces. I also suggest cutting your bread into less pieces - maybe more like 10 total pieces. I cut mine smaller and had a hard time fitting them all in the 9x13 pan!",

I couldn't eat it because the syrup hardened like a rock almost instantly (I am still trying to get it off my casserole dish)and the bread was a little too soggy for my liking. But if using a different syrup and adding a little more flavor to the eggs like some cinnamon it could be good.",
