My only complaint about this recipe is that the strawberries need some sugar. I suppose it depends on how sweet your berries are, mine were sweet but not enough.  And I ended up thickening the berries with about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.",

I found this recipe (didn't use the toppings) and it was amazing. The brioche soaks up so much of the eggs and cream mixture that the final result is almost custardy. I can see why this is the true french bread for french toast! While I have enjoyed challah in the past for this, the enriched eggy butteriness of brioche is perfect.",

Then found this recipe and tried it again for dinner after a visit to the store for the missing ingredients I needed. Just the smell alone told us how yummy we could expect this time would be. The taste blew us away - it was the first time my husband really had good french toast. I didn't even whip the cream right this time (so I dribbled it on like syrup) and it was still so delightful. I want to try to whip it next time. I did make a simple mistake, but I think it paid off - I added the sugar and vanilla to the egg/cream mixture so all that flavor soaked into the bread too. I made this using gluten-free bread and my husband even worried a little asking me which bread I used (due to allergy) because he couldn't believe it tasted so great.",
