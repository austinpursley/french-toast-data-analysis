Don't be scared by the amount of honey, I started out with only 1 tbsp and after the first slice quickly added the other tbsp.  They were not too sweet at all.  I used light bread and half&amp;half instead of heavy cream.  They came out great.  You have to cook them at a low heat because of all the honey or they will burn quickly.  Definitely a keeper.",

Our sons are huge Batman fans so I used a bat-shaped cookie cutter instead of a star and they loved it!  For bread I used Best Bread Machine Bread from this site, it had just come out of the bread maker and worked out wonderfully for this recipe.  I don't know if it's the difference in using heavy cream in place of milk as in traditional recipes, or the addition of honey, it just was a terrific recipe-unlike any I had ever had before.  Thanks so much for sharing, I can attest that this will be our permanent French Toast recipe from here on out!",

I used day-old Hawaiian bread cut in sticks (they were leftover from the dip last night for the Superbowl) and it was great! I fried them in a thin layer of vegetable oil and they were perfect. I like to sprinkle the cinnamon on while cooking to get it more evenly distributed. These tasted like restaurant quality french toast sticks! Yum!",

I love french toast and this was a very tasty new way to prepare it especially with the touch of fruit. I used thick cut Texas toast and all I added was a little nutmeg to the egg mixture. When these were nice and crispy I dusted them with powdered sugar, a dollup of butter and drizzled some real maple syrup over top - a really nice treat for breakfast with a glass of OJ!",

Don't make the mistake of using half and half instead of heavy cream, it just doesn't turn out as good.  It freezes well too and then toasts up nice.  Thanks for this recipe. 6/4/17 update: for 8 slices of Texas Toast, doubling the mixture barely makes it. Instead of orange zest, I used a few drops of orange extract and now prefer this. Again, best recipe for French Toast!",

The only thing I didn't like was the orange flavour, which took on sort of a 'burnt' taste even though the french toast itself was a light golden brown. I will make this recipe in the future, but I will leave out the orange zest. :) Thanks!",

Granted, I have not experimented with french toast recipes very much, but this one is a fantastic starting point. The orange flavor really came out. I used King's Hawaiian bread, and cut it fairly thick. Next time, I would double the egg mixture- I never have enough to do all my bread, but maybe I just cut it too thick. The orange and honey do sink to the bottom a bit, but I had my son whisk it between every few slices. The last two still came out very orangey, but still fantastic! Will definitely make this again.",

I did like the use of the cream instead of milk (I used fat free half &amp; half) because it made the \"dip\" mixture thicker so it didn't saturate my bread as much. The only trouble is, the honey causes it to have a tendency to burn (from the sugar content). So, be wary of that and cook slow &amp; low (but not too low or it won't cook right!)",

I skipped the zest and doubled up on the vanilla. Our favourite way to serve this is with that thick, fresh, crusty white French bread you get in the grocery store's bakery section. We fry it in a bit of canola oil and top with warm maple syrup.   Just a thought: I've never tried the star variation, but wouldn't it be easier in some ways to make the french toast THEN cut it into stars or other shapes? And then snack on the edges :) That way the points wouldn't be breaking off in the egg mixture. Just an idea.",

I decided to make these, modifying for his taste and I used 5 kid's size eggs (500g), half a cup of thickened cream, 1/4 cup organic, unhomogenized milk, 1 tblspn of honey, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, the grated zest of one small orange, about 1/4 tsp (to get a tblspn is heaps!) and a small squeeze of the juice into egg/cream mix. I more or less, only added small amounts of the honey and spices, so he would like it. He told me later that it was alright, but he likes just plain egg and milk better. I LOVED IT!!!! Seriously, I would not like it any sweeter than what I had it, and my dd didn't like it either, but ds and I loved it.",

I've wondered many times why it never tastes quite the same when I make it at home.  This recipe is to die for perfect.  I used hearts instead of stars and made a butterfly using two hearts and bacon for my daughters.  It was a huge hit with them and a huge hit with me!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",

I would suggest strong caution with how much butter you use, but if you follow the recipe and use milk instead of butter you get this even better version with a crunchy outside and a sweet soft centred inside, so i give this version 4 stars and mine 4&amp; 1/2",

Okay, my dh doesn't like sweet things usually with his eggs or french toast. He prefers the savoury flavour. I decided to make these, modifying for his taste and I used 5 kid's size eggs (500g), half a cup of thickened cream, 1/4 cup organic, unhomogenized milk, 1 tblspn of honey, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, the grated zest of one small orange, about 1/4 tsp (to get a tblspn is heaps!) and a small squeeze of the juice into egg/cream mix. I more or less, only added small amounts of the honey and spices, so he would like it. He told me later that it was alright, but he likes just plain egg and milk better. I LOVED IT!!!! Seriously, I would not like it any sweeter than what I had it, and my dd didn't like it either, but ds and I loved it.",

The orange flavor didn't come through as well as I had expected, so next time I will use more of the liqueur or an actual orange.  Watch out for cinnamon clumps in the batter! I should have used a whisk to mix to ensure homogeneity.  There wasn't enough batter left to completely coat the eighth slice, but this may be because I used regular white bread which is a bit spongy and could have soaked up more than thicker bread.  Cooked on medium-low heat as recommended and the slices came out perfectly (I prefer softer slices) with a bit of browning on the outside.  To serve I drizzled on honey and sprinkled a little more cinnamon on top, sopaipilla-style. Fantastic! The heavy cream provides a bit of richness (but not too much) and the toast is very satisfying. Yum! Also received top scores from SO who drizzled chocolate syrup on his.",

I used Hawaiian sweet bread that you can buy at the grocery store and did not cut into stars.  I cooked on the griddle with a little bit of butter.  I mixed together raspberries, blackberries &amp; strawberries with a teaspoon of sugar and spooned it on top of the french toast, then topped with fresh whipped cream.  It is the best french toast I've ever had!  If you don't like the orange taste, just omit the zest.",

I skipped the cinnamon since I used fresh cinnamon bread from a local bakery.  Finally don't have to go to a local restaurant to get fabulous tasting french toast!",

One recipe coating four thick slice. I agree that once it gets going, it cooks fast to keep the temperature low. Great flavor!",
