I do have to admit that I did not bother measuring the cream cheese or pineapple, and just eyeballed it. Very tasty, warm and comforting...the chocolate was a nice addition at the end. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I also personally didn't care for the combo of pineapple and chocolate sauce - but I did use fresh pineapple, canned would have been sweeter and probably tasted better. With the bread you would normally use for French toast (if you have a regular type you use) and a strong liking for the pineapple/chocolate combo, this could be quite delicious. It smelled amazing cooking!  As written it just wasn't for us. Thanks for sharing!",
