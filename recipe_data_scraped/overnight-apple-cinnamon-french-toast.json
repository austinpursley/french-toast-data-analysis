I think next time I make it I will only use one can of apple pie filling and then I will be able to add more bread. Also make sure you spray the foil or it will stick.",

            "reviewBody": "This recipe was amazing.  I chose it because, unlike many of the other \"make ahead\" french toast recipes, it truly was 100% ready to go in the morning.  Just pop it in the oven.  When I made it I used one can of apples, and made sure it was apples and water only--no high fructose corn syrup--to keep the recipe from being over-the-top sweet.  The apples turned out so delicious, next time I probably will use two cans.  I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread, and baked for 90 minutes.  Everything else I kept exactly the same.  I used a cake pan and had no problems with it boiling over.  I didn't turn it upside down, and I thought it made a very nice presentation \"as is\" with the cinnamon swirl bread.  The bread wasn't incredibly crispy, as pan fried French toast can be, but it certainly wasn't gooey either.  I think using a slightly more substantial bread, like Italian or the cinnamon swirl, instead of white or French, makes a big difference.  I made it for a brunch for 11 people, and everyone absolutely raved about it. It was so incredibly simple--15 minutes the night before and you're done.  This will definitely become a staple in my house.  Thanks for a real keeper!  Note:  I made this again and didn't bake it as long.  Yuck!  Make sure you bake it long enough.",

I tossed those with 1/2 cup melted butter (3/4 cup leaves a soppy, greasy mess at the bottom), 3/4 cup brown sugar, and 2-3 teaspoons cinnamon. I have always been able to fit eighteen slices of bread in my 9x13 pans (three layers of six). This bakes up perfectly in 70-75 minutes. Spraying the tin foil is an absolute MUST or it will stick. This recipe will be around our house for a long, long time. It's absolutely perfect!",

First time I made a 9x13 and could only fit 18 slices of bread, 2nd time I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 and fit about 10 pieces of bread. When it says to \"press down\", press down with some force, not  patting the bread. The first time I made it, I used the canned apple pie filling and it was good, but too sweet (and i LOVE sweet stuff). The 2nd time I peeled and sliced apples, put them in raw, and it turned out awesome! Both times I baked mine no less than an 1hr and20min.  I put a cookie sheet lined with tin foil under it to avoid bubbling over. I made sure to spread the egg mixture evenly over the bread w/ spatula, almost rubbing it in.  Spraying the tinfoil so it doesn't stick to the bread is helpful.  Also, I didn't invert it either time and it presented great and didn't seem to make a difference. People will be asking for the recipe guaranteed!",

Based on some other review comments, I made a couple changes to the recipe and got rave reviews when I brought it to a post-prom teen breakfast.  \n\nImportant:  Be sure to grease the aluminum foil you use to cover the casserole when baking or it sticks to the top layer.  I didn't remember to do that - not a huge deal though, because you flip it over to serve, so the torn part is hidden on the bottom of the dish.\n\nChanges:  I used fresh Fuji apples (I think I used 3 large ones) peeled, cored, and sliced very thinly instead of canned apples because I wanted no additional sweetness to the brown sugar and maple syrup called for in the recipe.  I also used Pepperidge Farm's Cinnamon Swirl bread for the bread ingredient - very yummy!\n\nThe finished product was not at all mushy.",

I have used 1 1/2 loafs of peppridge farm cinnamon swirl bread torn into pieces, with 1 can of apple pie filling.  That was my only modification of this recipe and followed all directions otherwise accordingly.  It was very easy to make.  Tearing bread seemed to allow the egg mixture to soak well as it appeared just a little moist/wet before I covered it overnight.  I baked 1 hr, and then tried the broiler suggesting but my syrup didn't carmelize (probably because I used sugar free, didn't matter, everyone still loved it)  Also, when serving, I did not flip the dish over, everyone scooped from the 9x13 pampered chef stone I baked/served it in.  I am being asked to bring to future Easter brunches as everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!",

I had no apple pie filling on hand so I used 1/3 of the Apple Pie Filling Recipe on this site submitted by Terri (thanks for that great recipe too!).  The 12-grain bread gave an extra chewy crunch and next time I think I may add chopped walnuts in between the bread layers!  Thank you Sue!! :)",

It was nice to have the variation with so many egg casseroles brought. \n\nI reduced both the bread and pie filling but my pan still overflowed all over my oven. Next time I will use one can of pie filling. With the bread, I will cover the pan once with slices, spread some egg,  cover the pan with another layer of bread, then egg and then be done. This should take less than one loaf of bread, I think. Oh, also, I left out the milk entirely and will probably do that again.\n\nAnd I will put a jelly roll pan on a lower rack in the oven, just in case it spills over again.",

If you must, you could likely bump up the brown sugar and butter if you're skipping the pie filling.  I think fresh apples would be way better.

I didn't even really up the butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the pan either, maybe just a smidge as I was measuring what was called for.  So good!",

Next time I will make my own apple mixture (cooking them in butter, a touch of sugar and cinnamon) instead of the pie filling - which I thought added a lot of sugar and also made the texture of the apples softer than what I would've liked.  I think overall, it is a good recipe though. I will make minor adjustments for our tastes and use the recipe a lot.",

            "reviewBody": "I love this recipe!  The reason for only four stars is I did make a few changes after reading the reviews.  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter.  I also only used one can of apple pie filling.  I used cream in place of the milk and I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of white bread.  It was a great base recipe though and the result was so good!  This will be part of our Christmas morning breakfast for sure!",

I like the idea of trying it with raisin bread next time,and also using my own apple pie filling. I did have to bake it a little longer, but not much, because I let it sit out for an hour before baking it, and did take the foil off the last 10 minutes.",

I baked the dish for 1 hour and 15 minutes whilst I went out for a run and relaxed.  \n\nI followed the recipe as written but added some sultanas to the canned apple layer.  I used a double layer of white bread on top.  \n\nMy only other suggestion is that lining the pan with baking paper and also putting baking paper over the bread mix before the foil to prevent sticking.  I lost the top crust of my bread layer to the alfoil.\n\nI did use the maple syrup glaze step as well.  I didn't find the recipe too sweet and my mum (who hates things too sweet) agreed with me.  The canned apples I used had no added sugar.\n\nI served this with low fat vanilla icecream.",

Like others, I thinly sliced fresh apples and lightly saut\u00e9ed them in a little bit of butter instead of using canned pie filling - they were perfect! I also used whole wheat bread (16 slices, fitting 8 to my pan and then adding a second layer of bread). I increased the eggs from 6 to 8 so that each serving had the equivalent of one whole egg. I baked it for 75 minutes to make sure it wasn't soggy. Adding real maple syrup and broiling for two minutes was a nice touch - really finished it off!",
