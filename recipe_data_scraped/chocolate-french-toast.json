It took maybe 30 minutes of cook time for 4. After all the french toast was cooked, I actually put it in the microwave for 30 seconds which helped melt the chocolate a bit more and was perfect right before serving. We used a Hershey's chocolate bar broken up into small pieces. The pieces didn't melt all of the way, but my husband liked that there were bites that didn't' have chocolate in it.  The sky is the limit on what you can substitute for chocolate, depending on what you enjoy. I can see peanut butter, strawberry jam, etc. Will be making this again!",

Though it's probably obvious, I would suggest sifting the powdered sugar onto the toast so you don't end up with lumps of powdered sugar. It is also a bit rich, so this has the possibility of making more than you need depending on the size of your family. (We each didn't eat more than one, even though they were quite good.) I'd definitely recommend this as an occasional special breakfast.",
