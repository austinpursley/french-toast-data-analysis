finished pie charts.
pie charts are difficult to do right. but trying to get them in a way that I like taught me a lot of matplotlib and other python tools

next:
- take a break from analysis
- finish up final clean up / qa
- publish "part 1" to website
- move onto anlaysis again
- bar charts
- etc.

3/4/2022
- consider expanding "cut" column beyond bread, if there's any value added there
- move onto analysis. outline / plan of metrics, etc.

(left of with "french_toast_recipes_4_cleaned_draft.csv")

1/6/2022
- second run through cleaning
- fix / reconsider bread units
- - -- - remove loaves, add "1/2-inch-slices" etc. as units?
- consider: "cut" column e.g. cubed, halved, 1/2-inch-thick etc.
- draft "analysis plan" e.g. metrics you think are interesting and want to extract + general game plan / idea on how to do it
- it would be cool to create a webpage for each recipe, somehow. that prob wouldn't work tho lol


1/20/2022
now:
- write recipe ID for each ingredient in "0ingr_cln" csv
- write "draft" version of v2 0ingr_cln
- manually clean recipe data (could take a long time)

1/29/2022
where need to pick back up:
- step 1: edit "2nums_key.csv" so that it's correct, final
- step 2: add code into "average_french_toast_1_clean2.py" to apply nums key
- step 3: remove clean4 as is, edit clean5 to clean4

overview of code process:
- clean0: cut out variants
- clean1: write out unique values to help with writing keys
- between clean1 and clean2, write units, nums, words cut keys
- clean2: apply keys have so far
- clean3: create ingredients key step 1, breaking down ingredeients further
- between clean3 and clean4, write ingredients key
- clean4: 

this process is sort of "organic" and more-or-less reflects how I approached cleaning without a clear idea upfront of how I wanted to approach it. bad? maybe, because planning is always good, but then again experience is golden as well. a lot of times you just got to dig in. and to be fair, I wasn't familiar with data yet either, so also understanding data as moving along etc.

in retrospect, it seems obvious that you'd want to
(1) determine numbers, cut those out of full ingredients
(2) determine units, cut those out of full ingreidents w/ units cut out
(3) THEN go through remaining unique ingredients. 
     - - cut out obvious words
     - - break them into basic ingredients e.g. bread, eggs, milk
     - - apply key to ingredients
     - - etc.

in "average_french_toast1.py"
I am cleaning data.
for example, looking through and figuring out different subsitutes for milk, egg, or bread (core ingredients, I've decided)

I'm going through recipes "non milk" varieties. finding + including other substitutes. (side note: alton brown doesn't use milk, he uses half-and-half)

subcategories of ingredients:
- milk and creams
- eggs and sub
- bread
- fruits
- vanilla
- sugar
- syrups

recipes with fucked-up ingredients:
chocolate-banana-french-toast
stuffed-french-toast-with-fresh-berry-topping
bacon-crusted-fruit-stuffed-french-toast

cyle of looking at data, enacting filters, checking filtered data, using feedback from that to implement more and/or better filters.
