I used thickly sliced beer bread that I made.  Since beer bread is generally dry, I figured it would keep the bread from being too soggy.  I did the caramel bottom but topped the layers with cinammon only and omitted the sugar.  I halved the recipe itself but halved the egg mixture again.  I don't think halving the egg mixture was necessary, although if I make it again I will eliminate the top layer of bread, and in that case halve the egg mixture.  It turned out a bit dry on the top layer, actually, bc of my modifications, so I don't think there is too much egg.  I'm just not a fan of having two layers of bread.  It turned out somewhat sweet but not too sweet for me, and I like the caramel layer a lot.  Thanks!",

            "reviewBody": "I made this exactly as directed and it was DELICIOUS!!  I used Thomas' Breafast Bread - the slices aren't as thick as texas toast (which the three grocery stores I went to for it didn't have) but they're thicker and heartier than regular white bread.  I put this in the fridge at about 8pm and didn't put it in the oven until about 10:30am the next morning.  It didn't turn out soggy, nor was the top \"toasty\" or dry.  It came out perfect!!  Moist and good with a lovely, yummy natural syrup.  You should note that when you pour the egg mixture over the toast the night before baking, it may seem like there's no way the bread can possibly absorb it all without turning out one big soggy mess.  I was worried!  When I took the foil off the top of the pan before putting it in the oven in the morning, however, I saw that all the egg mixture had been perfectly absorbed and the bread slices looked great (at which point I then worried it would turn out too be too dry!).  I went ahead and baked as directed. It turned out perfect - very moist but not soggy, dry on top, or too \"eggy\".  For those concerned about getting it out of the pan easily, I recommend lining the pan with Reynolds non-stick aluminum foil.  I did that and the servings slid out easily.  I then inverted them on serving plates, so that the brown sugar syrup was on top.  Awesome recipe that I'll be making for our family on Christmas and New Year's Day mornings!!",

            "reviewBody": "This was really good.  I do have to mention that I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I cubed 1.5 loaves of stale Italian bread.  I tossed the cubes with the cinnamon/sugar.  I doubled the amt. of milk and eggs. (No time for it to soak in, so I added extra). It sat 1.5 hours and I baked it longer than stated. The inner cubes were more like a bread pudding, while the outer pieces were nice and crunchy. No butter or syrup necessary! I greased the pan well and no sticky mess.\n\nNext time, I'll omit the extra sugar.  I might swirl in some cream cheese whipped up with some cinnamon. Maybe even toss in some chunked or sliced cinnamon apples. Or both!! Excellent recipe. Perfect for a no muss, no fuss breakfast!!!\n\n**11/16/11** Again, I didn't measure the bread, just used what I had in the pantry. I did cube the bread. I did not use the extra cinnamon/sugar. It was in the fridge at least 6 hours. The longer time in the fridge allowed the milk/egg mixture soak in, so I didn't need to add extra of either. The center was still a little gooey when the timer went off, so I stirred the whole thing, mixing the caramel throughout, then baked it for another 10 minutes. Stirring the caramel allowed ALL the cubes to get the caramel coating :-D   Absolutely something to make when you want a easy and delicious breakfast! I really do recommend using cubed bread, and stirring it during the last few minutes of cooking to distribute the caramel. No butter, syrup or extra sugar needed!!",

I only had one piece and I seriously feel the need to drink a lot of water to try to counteract all the SUGAR first thing in the morning.  I used regular bread since that's what I had on hand and it was soggy... eeeeewwwww!  So after baking it for 45 minutes I then put it in a pan and fried it (no more butter, just sprayed the pan) and it gave it a nice crispy kind of texture.  It was just not the greatest thing for breakfast... for sure the sugar on top is overkill - if you wanted to make this I would suggested leaving out the sprinkled sugar and just doing cinnamon.  And then just eat VEGETABLES the rest of the day.",

Hubby raved about this and I will say the flavor was absolutely wonderful.  I will make this again but probably bake it longer, or maybe cut back just a little on egg/milk mixture.

I did line my pan with aluminum foil and also sprayed it with Pam so the french toast didn't stick.  I did not try this recipe only because my husband and four kids ate it all!!  My step-son told me, \"I'm not a big fan of french toast, but I could eat this stuff all day, everyday!\"  Thanks for the easy and wonderful recipe!  Will definitely make again &amp; hopefully get to try a bite!",

If people know I'm making it, they will bring extra friends and the friends always come in saying how excited they are because they've heard how delicious it is!

I inverted it to serve so the \"carmel\" was on top and dripped down to the toasty layer. Between that and cutting it up to eat, it wasn't too mushy. It's very easy to make and the ingredients are things I had on hand. I'll definitely make it again! (may add fruit next time too!)",
