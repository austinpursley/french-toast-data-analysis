I found these perfectly sweet - not too much so. I used 8 1-inch slices of Como bread and had quite a bit of egg mixture left, so I'm thinking this recipe can stretch almost double without making more batter, FYI. We had ours with fresh raspberries and blackberries and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!",

We then topped it multiple different ways to see which ways we liked it served. My personal favorite was the simplest version- with powdered sugar sifted on top the french toast. The flavor of the cinnamon french toast is superb alone and the powdered sugar compliments it beautifully by adding just a touch of sweetness. My husband preferred his with both the cream/sour cream topping and powdered sugar sifted on top. We both disliked the version of adding pure maple syrup which was turned out way too sweet. Also our version adding fresh strawberries (or any fruit in season) was also a welcome twist on the flavor. Thanks for a great recipe. I can't wait to try this recipe on guests.",

I couldn't find French toast so I used brownberry Dutch county butter split top bread. I made 4 actual pieces and I had some of the batter still left over. Prob enough left over for 2 more pieces...yay breakfast for tomorrow:)",
