I used wheat bread, so I dont know what it's like w/white or texas toast.  Prob way better!  Have a go at it if you dont mind the greasy mess you'll have to clean up afterward!

I would, however, recommend that you should only make this if you have a deep fryer. I haven't tried making it on a frying pan but it would probably be messy (as one reviewer mention). I added a little nutmeg and cinnimon to my mix, I cut my toast into halves, diagonally, and then batter. I fried for about 3mins each side and then flip. They all turned out perfect. I had no problems. I gave some to my neighbor who loved it.",

I was thinking maybe other reviewers had soggy toast because of the type of bread they used, and the amount of milk called for.  I used French bread and a little more egg and less milk than called for.  I also made sure my oil was really hot so the bread would fry in it, not just soak it up.  I made a little blueberry sauce to top it off-just delish!  Hubby rates it \"Five stars and two thumbs up!\"",
