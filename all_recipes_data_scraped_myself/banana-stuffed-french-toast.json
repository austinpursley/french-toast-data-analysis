I use evaporated milk and egg, dash of vanilla and cinnamon, lightly soak the banana stuffed french bread in the mixture (more like dip two side and let them sit for a few mins, coz I dont like soggy mushy french toast) ,cook them on butter, and sprinkle them with powder sugar. VERY YUMMY even with my not so professional version. Just imagine with EVERYTHING the ingredient call for!",

Instead, I sprayed another pan on which I put the sliced bananas over low/medium heat, flipping them over after a bit. I did the toast separately. I put the bananas over the French toast, sprinkled some powdered sugar on top and it was very good.",
