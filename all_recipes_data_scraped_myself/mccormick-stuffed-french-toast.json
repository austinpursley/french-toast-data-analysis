I used regular cream cheese and let it soften at room temp, then used mixer to whip it.  Also, the night before, I sliced up a 16 oz container of strawberries and added a tablespoon of sugar. This morning, they were soft with a nice juice to top the french toast.  My family and my guests LOVED it! I will definitely do this again.",

We really liked the wheat-raspberry combo, but the apricot got kind of lost in the wheat flavor, so if you're going to do apricot jam, definitely use a white bread.  The nice thing about the wheat bread, though, was that it was nice and sturdy for soaking and flipping.  Finally, I used regular cream cheese with a little milk to loosen it up to a \"whipped\" texture.  All in all a yummy breakfast!",

I scaled the recipe down for one serving; since the amounts were so tiny, I just eyeballed the vanilla and cinnamon.  I used Italian bread and Smuckers Simply Fruit Peach Preserves. For my taste, I'd add less cream cheese and more peaches.  I'd say play around with the amounts to get the ratio you like.  I also rubbed a little extra brown sugar on top of my toast because, hey, why not? :) Thanks for the recipe! Easy and yummy.",

I think I will try to make this again, as I would like to have something a little different on weekends (usually choc chip pancakes and cinnamon french toast).  My biggest problem with this is that I have issues with soggy bread.  I think that next time I will cook each piece individually so they get nice and crisp (more on the well done side) and once they are done, I would put only one tablespoon in between and then top them with whipped cream and fruit of choice.  In our case, we will go with strawberries.  Thanks for sharing though.  It gives me a good place to start!",

I used a strawberry whipped cream cheese, French bread, and sliced bananas instead of the preserves. I cut down the recipe to what I \"thought\" would be half. But after soaking the bread for 45 seconds, there was nothing left to soak any more bread in. Those sandwiches turned out VERY mushy. I like my french toast sturdier than that. So I made a few more that I just dunked a little in the egg &amp; milk mix. They turned out MUCH better. I will try this again as is to compare to my changes. Thanks for a great idea!!",

I assume the recipe meant to soak the sandwiches for 2 seconds not 2 minutes as that would have made them too wet and they would have fallen apart when handling. Didn't need butter since I used my nonstick griddle. Served them up with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries I had prepared earlier on top. No need for syrup! Absolutely delicious!
