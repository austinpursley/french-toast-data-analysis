As we had plenty of fresh blueberries on hand, we put blueberries inside with the Nutella, then sprinkled extra blueberries and a little powdered sugar on top.  Definitely a treat for the sweet tooth!  (We also tried a variation with fruited cream cheese, instead of Nutella, for those without such a sweet tooth.  This was excellent, and could be done with any combination of cream cheese &amp; fruit.)\n**The reason this recipe lost a star is that it recommends cooking on medium-high heat, which burns the outside quickly without heating the inside.  Just like grilled cheese, this thick French toast works best 'low &amp; slow'.....  a medium-low temp allowed the bread to reach a beautiful golden-brown color slowly enough that the insides were heated through, as well.**",
