I also substituted a dash of freshly grated nutmeg in place of the allspice.  The recipe took much longer than what was directed.  Mine took about 4 hours on high.  6 T. butter is unnecessary, I downsized it to 5 T. and butter was seeping out the edges of the casserole. I will lower it to 4 T. next time.  Otherwise, the taste was very good and I will make this again.",
