I think a cinnamon raison bread would be yummy but as I try to eat whole grain products, I used whole wheat bread.  I may add some raisons next time and make half with nutmeg to see which flavor we like best.  My company had a choice of eating it plain (which was fine) or topping it with pourable Splenda, sugar, syrup, or fresh strawberries.",

It was very easy to make, and eventhough I didn't have any nutmeg and didnt add any orange zest, it still turned out delicious! I did however add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and increased the vanilla extract to 1/2 teaspoon(personal preference). I also melted the butter and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients. After cutting the (french) bread I then diped/soaked every single bread piece into the bowl of ingredients. I single layered the pan with the soaked bread, placed in refrigerator overnight, 5 hours later I flipped every piece of bread over and placed back in the refrigerator, 4 hours later I took out of fridge and sprinkled the pecans on top. I then placed in oven as recommended at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. The whole fam loved it, including my hard to please little brother :-)! I will definitely make again!",

I turn the bread immediately, to help even coverage, and sprinkled the other side with sugar. I omitted the orange zest, and greased a pizza tray with butter to bake the toast. ",

I left out the 1/3 cup of butter entirely. Since I didn't have any orange zest on hand, I added 2 tbsp of Grand Marnier to the egg mixture. I sliced the bread 2 1/2 inches thick (reminiscant of a brunch I recently had at a trendy place in the south end of Boston).  I soaked the bread for an hour and baked the French Toast for 35 minutes in the same dish - I had read that it was sticking for some people, but used a non-stick pan and took it out immediately after removing from the oven (a bit did stick - but it was so much easier than using two pans). And before serving, I sifted some icing sugar over the top of the dish. Yummy! Great recipe Wanda. ",

I dipped each individual piece in the mixture before putting it in the pan.  I also didn't use melted butter to coat the baking pan.  I just used some Pam.\n\nWhen cooking it, I did 20 minutes at 350 degrees but it was still a bit soggy so I cranked up the heat to 425 degrees and cooked it for another 5-7 minutes until the bottom was nice and brown.  It came out perfect!  It wasn't soggy at all and everyone LOVED it!",
