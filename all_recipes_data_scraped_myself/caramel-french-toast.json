The first time round there wasn't enough wet ingredients for the top layer of bread, which ended up dry and crunchy.  For my guests I added two additional eggs, sprinkled a little nutmeg between the layers of bread, and some on top too. Most importantly, I dipped the bread in the egg mixture before adding it to the casserole dish, to be sure the top layer was not dried out.  It came out perfect - moist, tasty, and beautiful. Our guests raved about the food, and everyone went for seconds - the most sincere food compliment I know.",

I used one apple and pared off thin slices with the potato peeler to cover the entire bottom of the pan. After putting everything in the pan and topping with the egg mixture I thought it looked a bit dry (my eggs may have been a bit small), so I poured a bit of cream over the top of the dry areas.  I may add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the egg mixture next time, but it was delicious as written.  Thank you for posting the recipe.",

You can easily flip it over onto a plate when it's done to show the apples and nuts and make it beautiful, or just flip each portion out onto the plate when you serve.  I will be making this often.",

That said, I made it without the apples and nuts and I am adding my review in case there is anyone else out there who would simply like to indulge in caramel French toast.  After looking at many recipes, I knew this one would make a great caramel base, and it did.  Very sweet, very indulgent, very good!  I think I miscounted my bread slices and didn't want it dry so I added more egg and milk...don't  get distracted while counting bread slices, lol.",

My only addition was to sprinkle the top with cinnamon prior to baking.   Made the night before and refrigerated made this an easy breakfast to pop in the oven.  Thank you mikeandjenn for sharing!  We really enjoyed it!",

I left out the pecans because of allergies, but I am sure those would make it even better. I did double the caramel sauce part of the recipe and added an additional egg. Have made it again for teenage boys since then.",
