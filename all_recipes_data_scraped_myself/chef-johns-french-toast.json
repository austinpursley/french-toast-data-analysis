    "description": "So you think you know how to make French toast? Maybe you beat a couple eggs, a splash of milk, a quick dip, fry it up in some butter, and drizzle with a little syrup? Sounds pretty good, and for 95% of the world that is what they consider French toast. But if you want truly amazing French toast, give this classic restaurant method a try.",

I just did it the way my Mom and Grandma taught me and never would have thought to lightly fry and place it in the oven. Since I love french toast I had to give this a try and I was pleasantly surprised. This came out crisp, light, fluffy and just plain delicious. I topped it with a dusting of powdered sugar and  REAL maple syrup. It was perfect served with fresh fruit and OJ! Thanks for a great recipe Chef John and an update on a truly classic breakfast favorite!",

I added a very small amount of powered sugar to the mixture. It was nice to put the slices in the oven as they were fried and also kept them nice and hot until all were complete so we could sit down and enjoy together. I will make these again, everyone loved then!",

Also, out of of powdered sugar so put granulated sugar into the blender. Instant powdered (-: Huge fan of Chef John! He's my go-to for any recipe",

I used only the vanilla for flavoring because I served it with cinnamon sugar apples saut\u00e9ed in a little butter, which was flavor enough.  I rarely ate French toast in the past because I didn't care for the flavor or texture; it was just like bread dipped in raw scrambled egg mixture and fried.

Browned on the stovetop using a cast iron griddle and then just placed directly onto a baking sheet and into a 400 oven for 13 minutes! I was worried that the bread would continue to brown and possibly burn but  by some sorcery it came out looking the same, except with an amazing texture. Thanks Chef John!!!",

I did so and it truly added to the mixture.  Made this for my wife and I and she raved about how great it was.  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe.",

Baking certainly works well but I'd use only yolks and add some sugar. It also doesn't hurt to add more cinnamon and vanilla extract if the taste isn't strong enough for you.",
