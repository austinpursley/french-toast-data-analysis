I start out with 2 eggs and a little bit of milk and sprinkle in cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract. Then sprinkle additional cinnamon on each side. Sometimes I've even added a touch of orange juice to eggs. Then I fry in oil until crispy. People that have had it say it is the best french toast. Such a good flavor with the vanilla and cinnamon.

The ratio of eggs to milk is perfect not too soggy or dry.  Did up all the bread and set aside. Used both a frying pan (3 slices) and a griddle (6 slices), went very quick. Added margerine to pan/griddle to give some more flavour and crispyness.  Put some thick-sliced bacon on parchment paper on a cookie sheet (with edges) in the oven at 375\u00b0F for half an hour ahead (drain fat and broil on low for last few minutes) and everything was ready at once.  Start to finish, including eating took one hour.",

There is some of the egg mix left--probably enough for 2-3 more slices.  Taste was decent--could taste the cinnamon but it wasn't overpowering.
