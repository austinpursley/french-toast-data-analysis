This was a huge hit by all.\n\nI did make a couple changes as well. First I used frozen peaches,  all I had. I loved the fruit topping! You don't need any syrup. Actually, I tried some syrup with too and didn't like the way it changed the flavor! \n\nI also addes some cinnamon to the egg mixture,  seemed to just go perfect with the peaches.\n\nNext I used confection sugar with the cream cheese which made it smooth. I also spread the cream cheese on one slice of bread then topped it with second slice and then cut the bread diagionally. Seemed a bit easier. \n\nI too used more than 8 slices, I think we used 13. I still had egg mixture left. I made baked oatmeal the next day with it, it was yummy too.\n\nWe totally forgot to use the whipping cream on top, it was so good even without it.\n\nThis was awesome - thanks for sharing your recipe!",

That being said, I must say that I was less than impressed with the strawberry sauce.  It was pale, opaque, and tasted more like sugar and cornstarch than it did strawberries.  I tried adding red food coloring, but stopped after it became apparent that I was going to have to add more than desirable.  I\u2019m thinking frozen strawberries might work better for the sauce, but there are better strawberry sauces out there.",

            "reviewBody": "Oh good Lord. YUM. That's about all I can say. I had cream cheese stuffed french toast once in my life at IHOP, and this recipe is right on par with it. This is so simple to prepare and cook, and it looks very elegant when it's all put together. Like a lot of people said, this french toast is very filling and one little triangle of this will probably do the trick to fill you up, especially if you serve it with coffee, juice, or fresh berries on the side. I thought I would add this note: To cut a few calories, you can also just spread light cream cheese or Neufchatel cheese between the slices of bread instead of mixing in the sugar/vanilla mixture, and instead of putting butter in the pan to brown the toast, use a no calorie PAM spray and leave out topping your toast with whipped cream. Absolutely wonderful recipe. I will be making this again!",

Made some extra toasts, then scrambled eggs.  The filling oozed out and made it not look too pretty.  My strawberry sauce didn't thicken much--I would bring to full boil next time.  I used our whole wheat bread that we always have.  I am sure I could tweak this and with some practice it would be awesome, but we just don't eat unhealthy all that often.  I made this to use up a bulk of strawberries from our garden, and it did the trick.  Thanks for submitting!  Oh, I originally forgot the confection's sugar--it really made a difference (improvement) when I added.  I left off whipped cream.",

I used frozen fruit for the topping, it's what I had on hand so it was a mixture of pineapple, mango, strawberries and peaches. Smashed them up while cooking and it was a very tasty topping!",

I put the cream cheese in the microwave for 10 seconds to soften it so it can spread better. When I tell you every Fridays morning my family request this for breakfast over anything. Great recipe",

I also used cheap sliced bread, and put a little bit of flour in egg mix - also some cinnamon as you can't have french toast without cinnamon!  Definitely substitute powdered/icing sugar for the white sugar in the cream cheese, makes it smooth.  For those who think this might be too sickly sweet, I found this to be less sweet than using traditional maple syrup.  Highly recommended and fairly easy to make",

I kept the slices whole, and not cut diagonally, and didn't spread the filling to the very edges, so no leakage of the filling while cooking. For the strawberry sauce, next time I'll use 1 lb. of fresh strawberries, but keep the rest of the sauce ingredients the same. Based on other reviews, I used confectioner's sugar in the cream cheese filling (1/2 cup), and cinnamon in the egg dip. Also, 4 eggs and 3/4 milk was enough. The pieces cooked beautifully in a cast iron pan. Added Reddi Whip topping for a nice presentation. There was one piece left, and I'm sneaking it right now! Thanks. Pamela, for the great recipe!",

            "reviewBody": "So yummy!  My husband and I really loved these for breakfast!  I pretty much went by the recipe except changed a few things around.  First I used powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture instead of sugar.  I also halved the egg/milk mixture since it made plenty enough for 10 slices of bread.  I also always add in a pinch of cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla in with the egg mixture.  I also did not do the step of layering the bread with the cream cheese mixture before cooking.  I dipped the bread slices and made the french toast on our griddle like normal, that way both slices of french toast are cooked up.  Then I layered with the cream cheese between each piece, and layered with the rest of the toppings.  These were super yummy and filling.  Thank you for the recipe!",

There was enough cream cheese mix and egg/ milk mix to use ~12 slices of bread. I also used frozen mango cubes instead of strawberries--what I had on hand. Also, no whip.\nThis was a hit with everyone.",
