No children in our household but the adults liked it too! I found that the batter wasn't enough for 6 pieces of the bread I used. I added another egg and some milk towards the end because I ran out. However it could have been the excessively large pieces of bread I was using. Also I didn't use white bread. I used a 7 grain bread. We don't eat white bread in our family, but it was fabulous. Served it up with a side of bacon. w00",

This recipe is the closest to what I had there with one exception - I use the thick cut bread like they do in Jamaica.  The bread gets less soggy and is easier to handle. This recipe is perfect in that there is no sugar added and only uses a few ingredients.  I through everything in the blender and use a shallow dish for the bread.  I've even mastered flipping the toast so I don't need any utensils.",

I made a few adjustments to the standard recipe and I highly recommend them to anyone who may want that extra little \"bam\". To the standard recipe, I added a little squeeze of honey to the egg mixture, and a bit of nutmeg (eyeball measure). I also highly recommend using \"texas toast\" (each slice cut in halves only- not quarters as suggested in the original recipe). Thick slices of bread holds together better and doesn't fall apart like regular bread will. Right before serving, drizzle a bit more honey (pancake syrup is an excellent choice also) across the bread, along with some powdered sugar and (optional) your favorite topping (chopped pecans, dates, preserves, sliced bananas, or anything else your imagination can think of. Guaranteed to have everyone screaming for more!! Bon Appetit!",
