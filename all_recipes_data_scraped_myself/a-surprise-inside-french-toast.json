    "description": "Stuffed French toast with a creamy filling is good paired with a fibrous fruit such as a 1/2 cup fresh raspberries. Note: This French toast is high in sodium, primarily because of the cheeses. For a lower-sodium dish, substitute no-salt cheeses if you can find them. You can also try substituting orange, almond or strawberry extract for the vanilla. This recipe is from The WEBB Cooks, articles and recipes by Robin Webb, courtesy of the American Diabetes Association.",
