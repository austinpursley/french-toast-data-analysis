I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts or pecans, two slices of white bread for each 2 inch slice of French bread, whipping cream, and Smucker's strawberry jam instead of apricot preserves and orange juice.  I had no trouble keeping the slices of bread together because the cream cheese mixture was sticky.  This turned out really delicious and really filling, and it took about 30 minutes to make.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!",

I make a batch of the glaze to keep on hand for \"normal\" French toast.  Even when I don't stuff the French toast, I use the batter recipe which has taken \"normal\" to another level.  Substitute almond extract for the vanilla for an added dimension.",
