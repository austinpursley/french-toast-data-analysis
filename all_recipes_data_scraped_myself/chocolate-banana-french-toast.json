I love french toast and this was a very tasty new way to prepare it especially with a combination of chocolate and banana. I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and am glad I did. I used thick cut Texas toast and all I added was a cinnamon and vanilla extract to the egg mixture. When these were nice and crispy I dusted them with powdered sugar, a dollup of butter, sliced bananas and drizzled some real maple syrup over top - a really nice treat for breakfast with a glass of OJ!",

She isn't big on banana so it was a great way to introduce the flavor to her. Instead of adding sliced strawberry on top I just made a sauce out of them and added crushed walnuts on top. She loved it and actually asked for a second helping, that never happens!",

For the chocolate milk, I just mixed some light chocolate syrup that I had in the fridge into skim milk.  I had a loaf of unsliced bread and sliced it thick, like Texas toast.  Definitely could taste both the banana and chocolate flavors, enhanced by the sliced bananas when serving.  The only negative for me is the color.  The chocolate makes the bread really dark (almost looking burned), so it's not so appealing to the eye.   But we love french toast, enjoyed this version, and we will make this again.",
