My only problem with this recipe is that they don't tell you what level of heat to fry the bread over.  I started at medium heat and burned a few pieces before turning the burner down, but our stove runs a little hot.\n\nedit:  I've made this lots of times now, and I prefer to not put the cinnamon in the batter and sprinkle it on top of the maple syrup on the finished toast on the plate instead.  The flavor comes through better that way.",

I normally use every ingredient listed in this recipe, subbing Texas toast for the bread, but have never actually measured ingredients. I just add what I think looks good. This time I followed this to a T and it came out very nice. I did use the Texas toast again this time because that is what I had on hand for french toast. And since this calls for a sweeter bread I added 1 T of sugar to the wet ingredients, but we don't use syrup. \n\nIf you can't find the bread called for in this recipe I DO recommend using the Texas toast. Thicker bread will not cause the toast to be soggy. Day old is even better. \n\nAll in all this will be my go-to recipe for French Toast for now on.",

I always cut my slices thick and sprinkle it with powdered sugar and a drizzle of maple syrup. Sometimes I add sliced sweet strawberries and/or serve this along with Portuguese Sausages.

I added (approx) a tablespoon of brown sugar and skipped the syrup, but that's personal taste.  Was a little short of bit of the egg mixture, added a tablespoon or so of root beer to the mixture before covering the last piece of bread.  It went well with the maple syrup.",

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the vanilla - didn't realize I was out after Thankgiving. However, this is the first time I haven't used vanilla extract in my french toast, and it was the best batch I've ever made! It really allows the butter from frying to shine through and I much preferred it. Served it with sliced bananas on the side, and real maple syrup (makes all the difference). Great basic recipe!",
