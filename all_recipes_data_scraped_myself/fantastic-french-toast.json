The kids flipped for the \"syrup\" as peanut butter and syrup is one of their favorite pancake toppings. I did add a little more milk only because I had to make a couple extra pieces of french toast because the kids were really hungry this morning and I used my own homemade maple-vanilla pancake syrup. This recipe was the hit of the morning. NOTE: I did not want the syrup to be too thick for the kids, so I cut back a little on the peanut butter.",

Use Vanilla soy milk instead of have two additional ingredients.  Its just the same but makes the dish a lot lighter and easier on the system.",

I tried to cut back on the calories a bit by using light syrup and natural peanut butter.  The peanut butter/syrup mixture reminded me of a glaze you would see on a donut! It was sinful!  I will make this again on special occasions!",
