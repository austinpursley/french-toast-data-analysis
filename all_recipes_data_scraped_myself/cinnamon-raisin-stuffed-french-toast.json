            "reviewBody": "This recipe is a good start, but can be better.  With some changes, including cooking technique.\n\nFor the custard I used 3 eggs and 3-ish tbsp heavy cream. To that I added vanilla bean, cinnamon and nutmeg. For the filing I used cream cheese, powered sugar and cinnamon. \n\nI soaked the cinnamon raisin bread really well in the custard mixture, poking holes in it with a fork to make sure it was worked well into the bread. I put two slices in the pan to cook over medium. When the bottoms were brown and the custard beginning to set, I flipped them and spooned and spread the stuffing on one slice then put the other slice cooked side down on top of the stuffed part. \n\nAfter it cooked through on the bottom I flipped it and finished cooking the top. I pulled it out of the pan and topped it with some homemade cranberry compote and a dash of the powered sugar.\n\nCranberry compote was fresh cranberries, clementine juice, coconut sugar, pure cane sugar and water boiled down until it turns into a delicious syrupy compote.",
