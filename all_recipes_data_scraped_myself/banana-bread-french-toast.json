The condensed milk made it taste Great. I added a few walnuts on top along with the powdered sugar. I suggest not putting as much powdered sugar as you would on regular French toast...It might be too sweet.",

I whisked the milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together, then stuck the bowl in the fridge for a bit while eating dinner. I cut two slices about 3/4 to 1-inch thick, dipped, fried, ate. Yum! I put a little Country Crock on the end product, the icing sugar was unnecessary (already very sweet). Thanks for a great snack idea!",

It only needed a little confectioners sugar, and was very good! Rich, and very tasty. I added a little fresh banana slices to top them off.",
