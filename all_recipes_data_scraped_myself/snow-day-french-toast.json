I like how the sugar caramelizes, *slurp!*, and how this French Toast recipie does not require cinnamon (no cinnamon fan).  I did do a little variation, using buttermilk, normal bread, and light brown sugar.  Tip: Make sure you mix the batter frequently, the heavy nutmeg sits on the bottom with the result that the last bread slices are extra nutmeggy.",

It proved less messy and I did not waste as much sugar.  It was a good recipe but I'll probably try another recipe next time.",

I cut this in half and still ended up with enough egg/milk to make 6 pieces of bread. I thought the ratio was off and I like an eggier dip and the bread was soggy and I had to cook a lot longer to get it firm enough to even turn over. I do think a thicker sliced bread though than the raisin bread I used would be preferrable.  No need for syrup as this is very sweet already and the sugar carmelizes on the outside. Don't try to stack these on a serving plate and then try to serve as they stick together and they especially stick to your plate when you are eating them and I wasn't too happy about the cleanup of carmelized sugar on my dishes. This did take a lot more butter and sugar than it says. More desserty though than breakfasty and will definitely give your kids a sugar high especially if you add the maple syrup!",
