            "reviewBody": "Wow, LOVED this recipe!  In reading a LOT of reviews last night, the common theme seemed to be to double the vanilla and the cinnamon so I did, and I also took another reviewer's suggestion and added a Tablespoon of brown sugar, along with the Tablespoon of white sugar.  The results were PERFECT!!  Just got done eating some for breakfast this morning and had to post a review right away, so good!!!  UPDATE (5/30/12):  This recipe is now a FAMILY FAVORITE!  I use Texas Toast and found that if you triple this recipe, it will make 2 loaves (30 slices) total.  I make it this way and then freeze all the slices that don't get eaten at breakfast... would you believe that these taste even BETTER after they've been frozen??  I just pop them in the toaster until they are heated through and they are PERFECT!  A great tasty homemade quick breakfast... these are now a staple in our freezer!  My kids love to eat these as french toast sticks.  After I reheat them, I cut them into 4 or 5 strips and then they dip them in maple syrup.  UPDATE (12/19/13):  Just when I didn't think this recipe could get any better, I used Kirkland (Costco) brand Cinnamon bread... AMAZING!!!",

I had day old Challah on hand which I was thrilled about, because that's the secret to making perfect French toast. Next time you make these, definitely use Challah and not just any old bread. That's how the restaurants get it so perfect, and that's the secret to making it like they do. Also, let it soak up all the liquid... the more liquid it soaks up, the better it tastes. I'll certainly be making these again!",

It really made a difference. In my opinion this recipe is way better than the restaurants. I pretty much followed the instructions although I eye balled the measurement of the ingredients and omitted the salt. The toast turned out golden brown on the outside, moist and fluffy on the inside...As others mentioned you have to let your bread soak briefly in the mixture to absorb some of the liquid flavor. DON'T just dunk and take out immediately. To avoid soggy toast do not cook too fast on high heat. Cook on medium heat until golden brown on each side...After the toast are done I usually sift powered sugar on top and serve with warm syrup. The presentation just looks pretty.",

For a little more \"oomph\", I occasionally add Grand Marnier and use a thick raisin bread...  As other reviewers have noted, you need to stir the egg mixture from time to time as the cinnamon and flour settle to the bottom and let the toast soak up the egg so the full flavor comes through.  HELPFUL HINTS:  Try serving this with a scoop of warmed apple pie filling spooned on top or add a caramel glaze (1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup cream, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla on a slow boil for 4 minutes) or Isybel's \"Blueberry Sauce\" from this site.  All are equally as good and wonderful with this French toast recipe.  Enjoy!",

            "reviewBody": "I've been making this french toast for years, and this recipe is the best, I think because of the flour. What I do is buy a pkg of Rhodes dough for rolls, thaw out 12 of them, cut them into quarters, roll in cinnamon sugar and drop them into a greased loaf pan. I let that rise until it comes to the top of the loaf pan and then bake it according to pkg directions. I do this the day before so it has time to harden up a bit. I slice it thick and it usually gives me about 8 slices. One note...if you do your bread a couple slices at a time, you do need to whisk each time before you soak new bread, because the flour falls to the bottom. Also, I like to soak the bread slices that I'll be cooking next, and then let them rest on a plate. It comes out better.",

            "reviewBody": "First, this recipe needs to be doubled in order to make more than 8+ slices of thick French toast. Also, it is a bit bland for my taste-I prefer a sweeter custard. So, here are my changes: 2-1/2 c 2% milk, 5 eggs &amp; 3 egg whites, 1/3 c fine granulated sugar, 1/2 c complete pancake mix, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon (+ more to sprinkle on as needed) and 1 tsp. nutmeg. I whisked everything together then put in the refrigerator over night. I used a very crusty, thick Greek white bread: dipped each side in custard for 30 seconds, let sit on a wire rack for 2 minutes then cooked on a griddle until light brown. Finally, I finished them off by baking in a 375 degree preheated oven for 5-6 minutes. So, overall this was an easy basic recipe to start with and modify to taste.",

            "reviewBody": "This did make for fluffier french toast, but I like mine sweeter, so next time I will be doubling the sugar.  Here is my handy tip for making the absolutely fluffiest french toast.  Cook your french toast in a skillet with a lid.  After dropping the french toast in the skillet, cover with the lid for a couple of minutes until the first side is brown. Uncover to flip.  Then recover to cook the remaining side.  This turns your frying pan into a mini \"oven\", so the french toast essentially \"bakes\" in the pan.  If you don't have a skillet with a cover, make it on your griddle, and cover it with a metal bowl.  This will have a similar effect.",

I usually never use a recipe for making this breakfast dish, but I read the reviews and decided to try it since I wanted \"restaurant-style\" FT. I followed the recipe as written, though I did use a little less sugar than called for, and I did add some orange extract (can also use zest) for some extra oomph. Overall, it came out very tasty, though I would make it again with some minor modifications to indulge my personal FT preferences. \n\nI took a reviewer's recommendation and fried the FT in butter-flavored Crisco, which, as she mentioned did not burn when I added more to the griddle (huge plus!!) and made the slices fry up picture-perfect. However,  I did miss the real butter flavor (and smell) that comes from frying in deliciously decadent butter. :-) \n\nNext time I make it, I will 1) use real butter; 2) sprinkle extra cinnamon on each slice just before frying (as noted by another reviewer, cinnamon in batter tends to sink toward bottom); and 3) use an extra egg and reduce milk to 3/4 cup. I prefer my FT batter more egg-y than this recipe turned out to be. \n\nNote: this recipe, as written, yielded enough batter for six, well-soaked pieces of Arnold Whole Grain White bread.",

The toast was definitely more crisp than when my husband makes it, but it may be because I had more patience and fried it longer.  It was a good Sunday morning treat.",

BUT since the batter was so much (we only ate 3 slices), I added more milk+brown sugar+cinnamon, cut up a thick herbed Arabian bread-bun and soaked in the batter...it smells wonderful!Soft and spongy with slightly crispy burnt edges. I plan to reheat/grill this later for a snack with some cheddar cheese,oregano and fresh tomatoes.And maybe scrambled eggs and baked beans if I'd like a heavier meal.    Lately my fridge has become too full and I don't know if the batter will keep well.To my delight, I found the recipe for French crepes in this site..virtually the same recipe, just had to tweak it a little- added more flour...and the result was some nice crepes! So just using this base, I've had sweet cinnamon French toast (with peanut butter + strawberry jelly..but better plain) and 1 large crepe (savoury cos I like mine with Bovril)",

It's less soggy because a lot of the liquid sticks to the flour, and so it stays on the outside and cooks up, rather than soaking in and becoming a wet mess. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I've never added sugar or flour to french toast before and because of the sweetness from the sugar I didn't even need syrup and it tasted great on it's own. Something else I noticed was that the mixture was more evenly mixed then my usual recipe. Normally by the time I get to the last couple of pieces it's just the thick egg whites left behind and the french toast comes out very \"eggy\" but I didn't get that with this recipe. Everything was so smooth and well blended. I think the flour may have contributed to that. This will be my french toast recipe from now on.",

First no matter what kind of bread you use it will work better if it is stale or left out over night, if you dont have stale bread put it in the oven on the lowest heat for a couple minutes before it turns brown. Second  MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE MILK AFTER THE FLOUR AND POUR SLOW THEN WISK, POUR SLOW THEN WISK, UNTIL YOU HAVE NO MORE MILK LEFT this will keep it from looking like cottage cheese. Third to avoid it getting super soggy it is best to cook on a low/medium heat (stove) or 300 on a griddle and do not rush, only flip it one time. Hope this helps.",

Also, I used thin, whole wheat bread and low-fat cinnamon-raisin rolls cut in half. My husband said it was the best French Toast he ever had. I sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar on the slices as they fried in the pan. What a treat! I think the flour helps avoid the sogginess that often threatens to wreck this dish. Will make again...maybe tomorrow! (;",

Its makes the mixture turn out very smooth, however you do have to add a more cinnamon and sugar to get a flavor with the same intensity.  All the slices will have the same amount of flavor instead of the first few picking up all the cinnamon.",

            "reviewBody": "I chose to give this recipe a try as many have said the added flour helps to keep the toast light instead of wet and soggy. The texture turned out very light and even a little crispy around the edges. The cinnamon was the perfect amount and the tip to make sure to give the mix a stir every time a new piece is dipped is an important one to keep in mind. I had made some challah bread the day before and found it to work beautifully in this dish. Thanks so much for posting.",

            "reviewBody": "I've always had a problem with french toast turning out too eggy and mushy for my taste; I guess the flour must be the trick, because this turned out just the way I like it.  I scaled it down to make two pieces for just myself, used wheat bread as that's all I had, and just eyeballed the cinnamon, vanilla and such.  I also added a little nutmeg.  I have no syrup, so I drizzled both pieces with honey, added brown sugar to one and powdered sugar to the other, and ate both with some sliced banana.  Mmmm. Thanks! I'll use this recipe for french toast from now on.",
