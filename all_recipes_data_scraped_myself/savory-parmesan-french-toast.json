            "reviewBody": "4 or 5 stars???  Hmmm....  It is hard to decide.  Bottom line is we did love these.  Just can't say \"French Toast\" or they expect sweet, cinnamon breakfast food.  I told my 'eaters' that they were 'Parmesan Toasts', served with soup for dipping, they were a hit.  Thinking these would be good cut into strips and have a Marinara sauce for dipping - could be good as a fast appetizer. (Update:  These really have to be served hot, although they re-warm pretty easily.  They were not so good at room temperature.)   I will admit to using half butter and half oil for cooking them.  Next time I would add a bit of garlic power to the egg mixture.  A nice way to use up stale bread. Thanks for a different take on 'French Toast'.",

The only thing I did different was increase the parmesan to 1/2 cup, because who doesn't love more cheese?  We tried it with blueberry jam, marmalade, and maple syrup.  The savory/sweet combo with the maple syrup was the hands down favorite.  This will probably not be my go to french toast recipe, but it will be in the rotation for a change.",
