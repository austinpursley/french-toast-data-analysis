I also reduced the amount of sugar a little in the batter. After making the recipe once, here are the suggestions I would make:\n\n1) Use reduced-fat or fat-free cream cheese.\n2) Use sugar-free jelly.\n3) WAY reduce the amount of sugar, probably at least in half, or skip it altogether. Next time I'll probably skip the sugar in the batter and just top with berries and powdered sugar instead. While the original recipe is quite scrumptious, it's absolutely way too sugary for a breakfast food. And that's coming from someone like me with a huge sweet tooth!\n\nI made this with the Amish White Bread (recipe on site) and it was, all-around, a delicious meal, but I hit the gym afterwards because it is definitely not at all healthy.",

It's as sweet as I expected something made with sugar and stuffed with raspberry would be.   EVERYONE loved it! If you like IHOP's version of stuffed french toast, this is even better. :)",

I used raspberry preserves because that is what I had.  I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon. I also used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of egg substitute, and reduced fat cream cheese.

Cut up a loaf of Italian bread I had sitting around &amp; used that to make this for brunch today; it was VERY well recieved.  I did cup the white sugar down to 1/2 a cup &amp; also sprinkled some nutmeg into the milk/egg mixture.  Loved the end result, if I were to note anything it would be that I would like a little more cream cheese flavor next time.  :)  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!",

The first one was soggy, so I had to be careful with the heat. After turning it down, sides still got burnt cause frankly I suck at french toast. The taste for me, using homemade strawberry freezer jam an cream cheese from the tub was lacking. Didn't love it. My brother, however, ate at least three [[sandwhiches]]. I take it he enjoyed it =) Thank you for this novel twist on french toast",

My hubby bought strawberry cream cheese, even though I had fresh sweetened raspberries ready.  It still tasted good.  I mixed 1/2 cup creamy whipped cream in to the cream cheese to help the texture. which was probably not necessary.  Everything was very good, and I will probably make it for  Christmas brunch with the family.",

I had similar issues as some other reviewers: It was somewhat soggy and there was way too much cinnamon, so much so that a half hour after eating it, my throat was burning. I love cinnamon, but it was just too strong in this quantity. In addition, the cinnamon taste was competing too much with the raspberry filling. I think with less cinnamon, this would be a good dish. However, the reason I gave this recipe 4 stars, is because the next day, this was SO YUMMY. I'm not sure why, but the overpowering cinnamon taste was mostly gone and the overall consistency of the dish was so much better (not so soggy). Do yourself a favor...make this the night before, refrigerate, and heat up in the morning for a tasty breakfast.",
