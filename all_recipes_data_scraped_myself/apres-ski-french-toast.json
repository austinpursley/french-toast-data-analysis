Serve with freshly squeezed or high calcium orange juice to get that extra boost, and top with pure maple syrup or a sprinkle of icing sugar.",

I do this because I can sneak nutrients into my children's diet without them knowing.\n\nI let some bread remain in a semi-open container overnight and used this because it was a little \"old\".  I also cut the bread thick since my kids like it better that way.  One thing I did change is I used maple sugar which is something I get when I'm up in Canada.  It adds a lovely nuance to this dish, I believe.\n\nA definite make again. Maybe New Years morning when we have a crowd of people staying over.  Thank you, super dish!!!",

The slices are much more substantial than bread from the store so the egg mixture was about right for two pieces. \n\nI really enjoyed the taste of these, they were quite different from my usual french toast! The spiced orange flavor came through very nicely, and with some butter and maple syrup made for a very enjoyable breakfast.",

I probably needed to cook it a little slower and longer because it was a little mushy in the center, probably because of the large amount of milk to egg ratio.

We won't be making this again.  Sorry.",
