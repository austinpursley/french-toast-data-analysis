            "reviewBody": "My family loved this recipe, and asked me to put it in my recipe book. I did make a few changes. I used regular eggs, real maple syrup, and 2% milk since that's what I had on hand. I also added about 1 tsp. of vanilla extract. After plating, I drizzled just a little more maple syrup over it.\n\nIf using regular eggs, I would suggest 2 large eggs. I used 3, and ended up needing a little more milk. Make sure to use cooking apples. I used johnathan apples, but you can try with others. I soaked the apples in water and lemon as I was cutting them. Oh, and it took me 15-20 minutes to core, peel, and slice the apples. Don't forget to add that time in when you're making them, or prep the apples ahead of time and soak them in some water and lemon juice. \n\nThis recipe is a keeper in my family!",
