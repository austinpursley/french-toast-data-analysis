I had cinnamon applesauce, so we used that, and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for plain ground cinnamon, which was very tasty.  I must agree that this recipe makes more than six slices of french toast - I think I made 10 slices before running out of liquid, so plan accordingly.  Also, be aware that the high sugar content of the batter makes it susceptible to burning, so keep a very close eye on the cooking toast; I found that medium heat worked best for me.  Enjoy!",

I used cinnamon applesauce because I had no cinnamon and used 1/2 a cup of milk.  I had no mixture left.  They were a LITTLE \"soggy\", but not enough to make a difference.  This recipe is a great way to get your kids to eat whole wheat bread too.  I also sprinkled some allspice on top.  I would recommend this recipe.",

It was the perfect consistency for me.",

If I do this again, I might add double the applesauce called for in the egg dip OR I'll just serve the sauce over the top.

It made 8 pieces.  Everything else was the same.  I cooked it on an electric griddle at 350.  Served it with applesauce on the side and warm maple syrup.  Powdered sugar and a fruit syrup would be really good with this, too.",
