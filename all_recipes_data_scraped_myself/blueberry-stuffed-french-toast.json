I'd say more like 400 degrees for 45 minutes. taking the foil off half way thru the cooking time. At 350, I baked for almost an hour and it's still very soggy on the bottom and barely cooked on top. Maybe the milk ratio should be looked at more closely. Unsure. Will try again and play with the cook times. I did add cinnamon to the sugared topping. I like that addition.",

            "reviewBody": "Good dish in need of some tweaking I think. First of all, this recipe screams for cinnamon. Add it to the whisked milk and egg mixture before pouring over bread. I used about a teaspoon, but use the amount that you and your family enjoy. Use whole wheat bread for a better texture, flavor and to make it healthier, making sure all the bread is saturated in the egg mixture before covering and refrigerating overnight. Add a bit more cinnamon to the sugar you sprinkle on top right before baking. I also double the blueberries in this recipe. It will be mostly bread if you don't. Nothing wrong with that, but I adore blueberries and can never have to many of them! The compote should also have double the blueberries, but I did cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup. It would be just too cloyingly sweet to me using the full cup. And you can add the blueberries as soon as the sugar and cornstarch dissolve in the water. I like my blueberries cooked into the compote, not just warmed up in the sugar water. You will get a much nicer flavor and consistency this way. Also, add a teaspoon of lemon juice right before the blueberries - it will really make a nice difference to your compote. Bake approximately 40 minutes. With a few (okay, a lot!) of changes, this is a stellar dish! This would also work wonderfully with apple or peach slices sauted in some butter and cinnamon in place of the blueberries and compote. Yum!",

I too made a few changes:  I discovered I had run out of white sugar so I used brown sugar in the wet mixture and also as the topping except with cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I used a small baguette cut into slices as the bread covering the bottom then pulling apart the cheese into chunks and scattering over the layer of sliced bread which made for nice warm chunks of cheese to bite into after baking.  I used strawberries instead of blueberries.  I baked at 450 instaed of the 350 for about 30 mins and it cooked perfectly.  I was originally going to try to make the compote using powdered sugar but opted to not make it after all.  I used syrup over the top for the kids whereas my hubby and I opted for no topping at all as it was plenty sweet.",

Worked great with gluten free bread, though I did cook a bit longer because it still seemed soggy after 30 min.",

I followed the recipe as written with only a couple of tweaks. I cubed all the bread and then cubed the cream cheese and sprinkled it over the bread. I also added extra cinnamon into the egg mixture and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top right before baking. It did take about 40 minutes to bake thru. But it was a huge hit with my house party the weekend I made it. Definitely a keeper.",
