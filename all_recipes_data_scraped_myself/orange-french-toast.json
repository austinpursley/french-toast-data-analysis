(It was the holidays!) \nWe soaked the bread mixture overnight and devoured it for brunch in the morning.  I think we\u2019ve found a new holiday favorite.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

Because the weather has been so warm, I didn't cook this in the oven. I used my big countertop griddle. I cut the recipe in half, which made six pieces of french toast. (This was enough for our breakfast plus some leftover to freeze for busy mornings.) I didn't have cinnamon bread, just plain ol' wonder bread. I added a bit of ground cinnamon to the egg mixture instead.  This came out good. I wish that it had been more of an orange flavor. I think that if I make this next time, I'll bypass the cinnamon and add even more orange zest. I'd like to see if I could have it come out like \"creamsicle\" french toast.  (If you make this on a griddle like me, be careful to watch it carefully. The  sugar in the egg mixture causes the bread to brown quickly. I came close to burning mine!)  EDITED: I made a second batch this morning for my husband who arrived home unexpectedly. I halved the recipe again and omitted the cinnamon. I think it's better without the cinnamon flavor as did my husband.",

            "reviewBody": "I did not care for this french toast at all (sorry Kristy!). Not only did this taste nothing of orange to me (not even a \"hint\"), it also stuck to my baking dish BIG TIME. I followed Kristy's directions to the letter, with the only exception being halving the recipe for my fiance and I. Our french toast was dry (it's a good thing it was not soggy, however, there needs to be a happy medium between the two, IMHO). For those of you thinking of giving this a try, I suggest a couple of modifications. First, instead of throwing out your leftover egg mixture, pour it over your already soaked french toast (otherwise, you'll risk everything drying out like mine did). Second, if time is short, fry your slices in a pan. I'm sure this would have alleviated my problem alltogether. I also think you should cover your baking dish for at least half of the baking time (and I'm not sure you need to bake for as long as directed either...). I might give this another try around the holidays using SAK's changes as my inspiration, but not anytime before that! My fiance and I were both full, but sorely unsatisfied. Oh well! Thanks anyways :)",

However, we preferred the taste of a couple we pan-fried (didn't fit in the pan we baked, so we did a test). Had the pan-fried stayed as fluffy as the oven baked pieces, it would have been much better. But still, no hint of orange flavor. I added a splash of Grand Marnier and flavors still didn't pop.

I followed the recipe to the letter (halving it) - using Safeway's Extra Thick Slice Raisin Bread - but due to time constraints, I simply pan-fried the french toast in butter (as opposed to drizzling it for the oven-baked option.) I let it soak about 5 minutes before hitting the pan and it was scrumptious!  So incredibly tasty and delicious!  Half the recipe made 6 slices. My whole family loved it, it had the orange flavor that was definitely there, but not overwhelming.  To me, this recipe is perfect as is!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Kristy!  My mouth is watering just remembering how good this french toast is! :)  This recipe is a definite keeper, I'll be using it over and over again!",
