I used bread that I had made--Cinnamon Raisin Bread I--and still sprinkled cinnamon on top.  The bread was mushy on both sides, maybe bc I turned it over before baking.  I love peaches, but I'm wondering if elminating those and just using peach syrup in the egg mix would make for a better french toast.  Also, I think the recipe calls for way too much egg mixture.  I would halve it next time--way too  much liquid when we were done.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Tried a couple of the peaches, and they, too, had a funny taste/texture.  I followed the recipe to a T - directions and everything - so I know I didn't do anything wrong.  There was way too much liquid on the bottom when it came out of the oven.  It wasn't \"syrupy\" like it says for drizzling on top.  It was pretty much just a watery liquid that filled my baking dish on the bottom.  I even let it bake for 40 minutes (10 minutes longer than it calls for) and that didn't help.  I wont make this again.  It looks like others have had luck with it, but my first time trying it was a complete fail - so I wont waste my time next time.",
